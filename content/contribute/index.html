      <p>
        If you see a way to improve any piece of code, please let us know. There's no such thing as too small an improvement. (If the issue is about our documentation, please see <a href="#improve-docs">next section</a>.) If you think you might have found a bug, please start by making sure it hasn't already been
        <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues?state=open">reported</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [M#IIf the issue doesn't already exist, please <a href="http://codepen.io/ionic/public-list/">fork a codepen</a> that demonstrates the problem (try to use as little code as possible: the more minimalist, the faster we can debug it). Next, <a href="/submit-issue/">create a new issue</a> that explains the problem in detail, and provides enought background as to the circumstances that triggers it. Don't forget to include the link to the codpen or plunkr you created, along with any screenshots that may identify the issue.

      <h2>Help Improve The Docs</h2>
      <p>
        See a typo? Have a better way to describe Ionic within our documentation? Have a great tutorial? Please help make our docs awesome. The docs for our directives and services are generated from our source code using <a href="https://github.com/angular/dgeni">dgeni</a>, so fork the <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic"> main Ionic repo</a> to make an edit there. For anything site related, fork the <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-site">ionic-site repo</a>, add, correct or improve the content, then submit a pull request with the improved docs. Not sure what to do? <a href="https://ionicframework.com/submit-issue/">Submit an issue</a>, and we will address it.

    <!-- Pull Request Guidelines
      ================================================== -->
    <div class="docs-section" id="pull-request-guidelines">
      <h2>Pull Request Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance of getting accepted, do not bundle more than one "feature" or bug fix per PR. A large "all-in-one" PR makes it very hard to accept if one of the fixes or features has issues. It's always best to create two or more smaller PRs than one big one. Make sure any changes are done to the source code, not the compiled JavaScript or CSS.
      </p>
    </div>


    <!-- Conventions
      ================================================== -->
    <div class="docs-section" id="conventions">
      <h2>Conventions</h2>
      <p>
        We try to follow best practices as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any SCSS changes, try to keep CSS properties sorted in a reasonable order, with layout and sizing properties first, and cosmetic properties below that. See our code for examples. Feel free to run your code through <a href="http://csscomb.com/">CSS Comb</a>, which will sort your CSS properties in a good order. Always use two spaces, no tabs. This goes for any HTML, CSS, or Javascript. Ionic uses an <code>.editorconfig</code> file, which most editors support, to enforce these coding standards.

      </p>
      <p>
        All JavaScript must pass <a href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a>, which helps detect errors and potential problems in your code.
      </p>
      <p>
      Additionally, almost all Javascript code <strong>must have an accompanying test case</strong>. To run our test suite, install <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html">Karma</a> and follow the <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic#development">Development commands</a> as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
    <pre>
$ sudo npm install -g karma gulp
$ gulp
$ gulp karma</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      More information can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic#development">README</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Any tests you write should go in the <code>test/TYPE</code> folder structure. Copy the format from other tests to write your own.
