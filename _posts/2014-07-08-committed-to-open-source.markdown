If you've ever been to [code.ionicframework.com](http://code.ionicframework.com) and scroll down to the bottom you will see "Awesomely sponsored by MaxCDN".  Ionic is just one of the many [Open Source projects we sponsor](http://www.maxcdn.com/company/open-source/).  Each month we donate over 1.1 petabytes of bandwidth to the community.  That is a little over $20,000 a month if we paid retail pricing, which we don't, but believe me, it's still far from free.

With that said, I strongly believe that companies that build businesses on open source software (or hardware) have a duty to give back to the community.  I have heard some say "We are a scrappy startup and we can't dedicate resources to contributing back to Open Source". I think that is bull shit.

Giving back to Open Source is not a full time job.  Also writing code is not the only way of giving back.  For example, lets say your company uses WordPress as their CMS/Blog.  Why not sponsor a local [WordCamp](http://central.wordcamp.org/)?  It isn't a lot of money ($100-300) and you get great benefits like having your logo and link on the website.  Most importantly you are supporting the Open Source Community.  


### "My company won't let me..."

I know I'm very fortunate to have the founders of the company I currently work for support my every decision when it comes to supporting open source. I cringe when I go to a conference and talk to someone who really wants to open source something cool they made and would benefit the community at large, yet they are **AFRAID** to ask management. **NEVER** assume that they will say "no" off the bat.

The best way to get buy in from management is to sell them on the value you are getting with free (as in beer and freedom) software.  Look at a similar commercial version of the product your company depends on and show them that if the company had to pay for this product, it would cost them X amount a year.  If that doesn't work try one (or all) of the following:

* It will be great for [recruiting](http://blog.maxcdn.com/recruiting-humans-http-headers/) new talent, not to mention **WAY** cheaper.
* It will raise brand awareness among your peers who influence purchasing decisions.
* It will help differentiate your company among your competitors.

### "Tried it and they said...YES!"

Awesome!  Now you got the **easy** part out of the way.  I say easy because it takes a lot of dedication to make an open source project flourish.  Here are some tips that I have learned over the past 2 years:

####Promote it
You are now the CEO of your open source project.  In order for it to become a success you need to get out there and tell the world what your project does.  This can be done through Social Media (Twitter is the best IMO), Blogging and presenting at meet-ups or conferences.  If you believe you've built the best solution to a problem you know your peers constantly complain about, target them with that message.  After that, it will practically sell itself.  

####Own it 
If there is any issue, get on it and don't wait.  Even if it isn't your fault, you want to make sure that you did everything to mitigate the issue.  Don't just close the issue without investigating.  It is ok to keep issues open until you find out what is going on and make sure that you communicate with the user(s).

####Use it
The only way to make your product better is to dog food your project any possible way you can.  How can you convince others to use your open source software if you don't?


####Take aways
The Open Source community needs you to help sustain the ecosystem.  Every small contribution makes a **HUGE** impact.
