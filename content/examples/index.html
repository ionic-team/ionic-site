<h1>Ionic Code Samples</h1>
<p>
  For a growing list of Ionic Code samples, check out our <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/ionic/pens/public/">Codepen</a> demo.
</p>

<p>
  Note that for many of our demos we use <a href="https://code.ionicframework.com/">Ionic's CDN</a> and encourage any online examples to do the same. However, its best to use your own local copies of the framework's files when building a Cordova/Phonegap app. The <a href="https://code.ionicframework.com/">CDN</a>, and each of Ionic's versions, are provided only for online demo conveniences, and should not to be used in Cordova/Phonegap apps.

<p>
  <em>If any of the samples are broken, <a href="/submit-issue/">please let us know</a>
  and we'll fix them up.</em>
