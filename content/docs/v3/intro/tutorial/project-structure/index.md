# Project Structure

Let's walk through the anatomy of an Ionic app. Inside of the folder that was
created, we have a typical [Cordova](/docs/v1/what-is/#cordova) project
structure where we can install native plugins, and create platform-specific
project files.

<h3 class="file-title">./src/index.html</h3>

`src/index.html` is the main entry point for the app, though its purpose is to
set up scripts, CSS includes, and bootstrap, or start running our app. We
won't spend much of our time in this file.

For your app to function, Ionic looks for the `<ion-app>` tag in your HTML. In
this example we have:

```html
<ion-app></ion-app>
```

and the following scripts near the bottom:

```html
<!-- Ionic's root component and where the app will load -->
<ion-app></ion-app>

<!-- The polyfills js is generated during the build process -->
<script src="build/polyfills.js"></script>

<!-- The vendor js is generated during the build process
     It contains all of the dependencies in node_modules -->
<script src="build/vendor.js"></script>

<!-- The main bundle js is generated during the build process -->
<script src="build/main.js"></script>
```

These scripts are all generated by the build system, so no need to worry about
them.

<h3 class="file-title">./src/</h3>

Inside of the `src` directory we find our code. This is where most of
the work for an Ionic app will take place. When we run `ionic serve`, our code
inside of `src/` is [transpiled](/docs/developer-resources/what-is/#transpiler) into the
correct JavaScript version that the browser understands (currently
[ES5](/docs/developer-resources/what-is/#es5)). That means we can work at a higher level
using TypeScript, but compile down to the older form of JavaScript the browser
needs.

`src/app/app.module.ts` is the entry point for our app.

Near the top of the file, we should see this:

```ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyApp, HelloIonicPage, ItemDetailsPage, ListPage],
  imports: [BrowserModule, IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp)],
  bootstrap: [IonicApp],
  entryComponents: [MyApp, HelloIonicPage, ItemDetailsPage, ListPage],
  providers: [StatusBar, SplashScreen, {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler}]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Every app has a _root module_ that essentially controls the rest of the
application. This is very similar to `ng-app` from Ionic 1 and AngularJS. This is
also where we bootstrap our app using `ionicBootstrap`.

In this module, we're setting the root component to MyApp, in
`src/app/app.component.ts`. This is the first component that gets loaded in our
app, and typically it's an empty shell for other components to be loaded into.
In `app.component.ts`, we're setting our template to `src/app/app.html`, so
let's look in there.

<h3 class="file-title">./src/app/app.html</h3>

Here's the main template for the app in `src/app/app.html`:

```html
<ion-menu [content]="content">

  <ion-header>
    <ion-toolbar>
      <ion-title>Pages</ion-title>
    </ion-toolbar>
  </ion-header>

  <ion-content>
    <ion-list>
      <button ion-item *ngFor="let p of pages" (click)="openPage(p)">
        {% raw %}{{p.title}}{% endraw %}
      </button>
    </ion-list>
  </ion-content>

</ion-menu>

<ion-nav [root]="rootPage" #content swipeBackEnabled="false"></ion-nav>
```

In this template, we set up an [`ion-menu`](/docs/components/#menus) to
function as a side menu, and then an [`ion-nav`](/docs/api/components/nav/Nav/)
component to act as the main content area. The
[`ion-menu`](/docs/components/#menus)'s `[content]` property is bound to the
local variable `content` from our [`ion-nav`](/docs/api/components/nav/Nav/), so it
knows where it should animate around.

Next let's see how to create more pages and perform basic navigation.
