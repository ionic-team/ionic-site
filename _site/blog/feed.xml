        <title>Web Developers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Turning Web Developers into Mobile Developers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ionic has grown in popularity and expanded beyond just being a mobile framework for AngularJS, we&amp;#39;ve started to
really understand what kind of developer is drawn to Ionic, and how we can best cater to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core, Ionic makes it possible for web developers to build compelling mobile apps without having to change careers. That&amp;#39;s it. That&amp;#39;s why we exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when we started Ionic, I wasn&amp;#39;t really sure who we were going after. Initially, I hoped we&amp;#39;d draw native developers away from Obj-c and Android to the web stack. I really wanted to shake up the industry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that happening to an extent which is wonderful, but we&amp;#39;ve also realized that such a change is pretty threatening to native developers. What does the job market look like for native devs when more people can build apps? What happens when businesses realize they are paying too much and taking too long to get to market with apps for major platforms? What happens when the native SDKs are abstracted sufficiently away that it no longer makes sense to work so close to the metal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly realized that native developers are incentivized to keep the supply for their talents scarce. To make sure that hiring and finding native developers is hard. Of course, they don&amp;#39;t do this maliciously or even consciously, but that&amp;#39;s the nature of job markets. It does seem to explain the vicious backlash against mobile SDKs that are too &amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like a traitor, like we are taking all this hard earned knowlege and experience from being a native developer and bringing it to everyone through the web stack. That we are sabotaging the desirable suppy-and-demand characteristics of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dirty secret in mobile development is that it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to find good native developers to build mobile apps. This, despite the fact that many large companies have web developers on staff. We want to empower those developers to build for this exciting platform &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; without needing much retraining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that extent, I think it&amp;#39;s a risky position to be in as a native developer. I&amp;#39;m not sure the market can sustain the cost and hiring challenges. I also don&amp;#39;t like betting against the web because the web stack is not only brilliantly abstract, but widely understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the native development world, too much knowledge is locked up in obscure native APIs, and difficult-to-learn languages. I say that as someone that has built both iOS and Android apps and has written a good amount of C/++. These toolkits are just &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; for most developers to master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web platform isn&amp;#39;t immune to this. We all know how hard it was to learn Angular 1. There is some pride to having gained that hard earned knowledge. We cling to it and protect it, as if we&amp;#39;d be out of a job if we shared it with anyone else. The possibility that the time invested learning something new might be for nought is frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe the web stack is going to stay the most broadly applicable technology for decades. We think Web Developers will end up being the most versitile developers in the market, and will enjoy long term job stability, growth, and diversity of work because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means we think one of the smartest decisions aspiring developers can make is learning HTML5, Javascript, and CSS. It runs practically anywhere, and does so in a way that is constantly improving. Ionic wants to be the best option for those web developers, but our true calling is making sure the web development stack can compete with proprietary ones.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ionic 1.0 RC1: SVG Spinners</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; src=&quot;http://s.codepen.io/ionic/debug/GgwVON?&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve released Ionic RC1, we want to share more about our favorite new Ionic features. Last week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adamdbradley&quot;&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; wrote about his favorite new feature in Ionic RC0, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/blog/rc0-swipe-to-go-back/&quot;&gt;Swipe to Go Back&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I’m most excited about our new animated SVG spinners, and I thought I’d explain why we decided to change the spinners and what the new SVG spinners can do for your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why SVGs?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would we need new spinners? After all, Ionicons already come with animated font icons that get the job done. Well, the older animated font icons were subjected to the browser’s font rendering, which differs between iOS and Android and among all the different versions of Android. Normally, this wouldn’t make a difference, since all fonts get rendered out as static content, but the animated font icons weren’t static. Depending on which browser you were using, they would rotate, and users would see the icon wobble. We had to face the facts: Animated Font Icons Were Not An Ideal Solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin-right: -160px&quot;&gt;

 &lt;div class=&quot;phone-case&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p data-height=&quot;568&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;3572&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;OPaxME&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result&quot; class=&#39;codepen&#39;&gt;See the Pen by &lt;a href=&#39;http://codepen.io/ionic/pen/OPaxME&#39;&gt;Ionic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#39;http://codepen.io/ionic&#39;&gt;@ionic&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&#39;http://codepen.io&#39;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;script async src=&quot;//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Enter Animated SVGs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since animated icons were not a perfect solution, we decided to move to full SVG icons, in order to create icons that weren’t subjected to the browser&amp;#39;s font rendering. An added benefit was that since we use Angular, we could encapsulate a bunch of different icons inside a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/master/js/angular/controller/spinnerController.js&quot;&gt;directive&lt;/a&gt;, and developers wouldn’t have to deal with the SVG markup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did we lose the ability to style the icons? Nope; you’ll still get to customize the icons to the colors of your choice and even use the built-in Ionic colors. To top it off, since the icons are a directive, we can switch them out at run time for Platform Continuity, and iOS and Android will each get the correct icons. This is also configurable, so you have the option of passing in one icon for both platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/docs/nightly/api/directive/ionSpinner/&quot;&gt;documentation for the spinners&lt;/a&gt; and try them out in your own app! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Platform Continuity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/platform-continuity-ionicframework.png&quot; style=&quot;min-width:100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about how it feels when you open up a particularly well designed iOS or Android app. The entire experience is predictable and clear; everything functions according to your expectations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve a user experience this seamless and comfortable, you&amp;#39;ll need to design your app according to the style guidelines of each major mobile platform. Users expect apps to look familiar on their mobile platform of choice: a centered header on iOS, a left-aligned header on Android; tabs on the bottom on iOS, and on the top on Android; rounded icons in iOS, etc. Until now, accomplishing this was time-consuming, expensive, and downright difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a functionality standpoint, the “write once and run anywhere” mantra still applies, but from a design standpoint, it’s more akin to “write once; check the platform style guidelines; write some more; check again; deploy anywhere.” That’s pretty overwhelming when you’re trying to write an app for two or more platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ionic helps to solve this problem out of the box. Design is a critically important part of an app; it’s what makes an app attractive and enjoyable to use. Ionic helps developers build beautiful apps more quickly, and by incorporating &lt;a href=&quot;http://adamdbradley.github.io/ionic-present/#/15&quot;&gt;Platform Continuity&lt;/a&gt; into Ionic, we provide developers with the tools to create clearly structured apps whose design elements and functionality meet users’ expectations, no matter which platform they’re using. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ionic allows you to customize settings, such as headers, tabs, transitions, toggles, action sheets, back-buttons, checkboxes, nav-buttons, and fonts, for each major platform. For example, now Ionic checkboxes automatically look like iOS checkboxes on iOS and Android checkboxes on Android. Our action sheet below looks significantly different on iOS than on Android. All of this happens automatically and is customizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/actionsheet-platform-continuity.png&quot; style=&quot;min-width:100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, our criteria for acceptance into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://showcase.ionicframework.com/&quot;&gt;Ionic Showcase&lt;/a&gt; will emphasize platform continuity, in addition to beautiful design and unique functionality. We look forward to seeing what you build!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear more about platform continuity in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wvr11fvCeu4?t=4m41s&quot;&gt;Adam’s talk at ng-conf&lt;/a&gt;:

        <title>Invite a friend to your Ionic App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest requests for &lt;a href=&quot;http://view.ionic.io/&quot;&gt;Ionic View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionic.io/&quot;&gt;ionic.io&lt;/a&gt; is to be able to invite co-workers, friends, and customers to preview and test your app. This would make the Ionic View app a great beta-testing experience that is quite a bit easier to use than TestFlight, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can! To invite someone to view and test your app, just run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ionic share EMAIL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to share the current app with the person at that email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this new feature, make sure to update to the newest version of Ionic CLI and upload your app to ionic.io:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ionic login
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ionic upload
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ionic share EMAIL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, soon you&amp;#39;ll be able to share right from Ionic View and ionic.io. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ionic RC0: New Swipe to Go Back Feature</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week at ng-conf, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wvr11fvCeu4&quot;&gt;we announced Ionic RC0&lt;/a&gt;, which includes several new features about which we’re really excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one, a feature near and dear to my heart, is Swipe to Go Back. Ionic now uses interactive transitions, rather than just static animations. Swipe to Go Back works the same way the back button does, animating the nav bar title and back buttons. You can swipe from the left of a page to go back to the previous page. Letting go at certain points of the transition will cause the view to either snap back or complete the navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature, which is common in native iOS apps, is only offered for iOS, because Android doesn’t do this. It’s only in Cordova, because standard mobile browsers provide their own swipe to go back capabilities. The URL still changes and is no different than any other navigation with the same lifecycle events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the video of my presentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wvr11fvCeu4?t=9m1s&quot;&gt;where I talk about Swipe to Go Back&lt;/a&gt;:

        <title>Ionic and Angular 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/ionic-angular-v2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;min-width:100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Ionites,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a hugely successful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ng-conf.org/&quot;&gt;ngConf&lt;/a&gt; last week, the Ionic office is abuzz with Angular 2, and what it means
for Ionic. The number one response from ngConf is that Angular is here to stay, and will only continue to dominate in the future. We are all investing in the right framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I want to quickly address the questions we&amp;#39;ve gotten about Angular 2, and what it means for Ionic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we will absolutely be supporting Angular 2, and we will release full Angular 2 support in Ionic v2. In fact, we are already working on it! I don&amp;#39;t have a timeline for that (yet!), but chances are it will come earlier than v1 did :) And, of course, we will support Ionic v1 through all of this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week we are doing an &amp;quot;Angular/Ionic 2 Summit.&amp;quot; The Ionic core team will be locking themselves in a room (and we are flying in some remotes!) to go through all the lessons learned over the last year and half. Everything we did right (and &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;!) with Ionic v1, and what we will fix in v2. Yes, there will be coding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to become experts in Angular 2, and we are working in parallel with the Angular team to make sure Angular 2 is an incredible frontend framework on mobile, and that Ionic can build the best mobile framework on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Angular 2, we want to make Ionic faster, easier to use, and more powerful. The new component model makes building components and extending Ionic much easier. Angular 2 apps are easier to write and interact with your data in a more expected way. The framework naturally works with web standards instead of creating new ones. Learning Angular 2 will be easier, and more developers will be able to work on the code base. A win-win-win-win*&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes, Angular 2 support is a 100% for sure. We will have more info when we are ready to release it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onward!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Collection Repeat: Estimate, Iterate, Improve</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Collection repeat is Ionic&amp;#39;s buttery-smooth solution for scrolling huge lists. Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableViewDelegate_Protocol/index.html&quot;&gt;iOS&amp;#39;s UITableView&lt;/a&gt;, we switch out elements as the user scrolls, so that only the minimum necessary elements are rendered. We released our first version of collection repeat &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/blog/collection-repeat/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; and have been improving it since then. Recently, we identified some huge potential performance increases and decided a complete refactor was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the details, let’s talk about how collection repeat works at the most basic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Essentials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say there are four items on the screen, matching items 1-4 in the user&amp;#39;s array of data: As the user scrolls down, item 1 will move up and out of view. Once it&amp;#39;s fully out of view, its element will move to the bottom of the screen to the space where item 5 should be, as item 5 moves up and into view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we take the Angular scope that just represented item 1, assign item 5&amp;#39;s data to it, and trigger a digest on that scope to make the element represent item 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow the above strategy and position every element properly, we need every item&amp;#39;s exact width and height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Old and the New&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our first iteration of collection-repeat, we required developers to provide dimension stats for every item, because we assumed that every item might have a unique width and height:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collection-repeat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;item in items&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collection-item-height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;75&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collection-item-width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;#39;100%&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {{item}}
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-item&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new syntax, height and width are optional:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collection-repeat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;item in items&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {{item}}
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-item&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, in the common case where every item is the same size, you don&amp;#39;t have to provide dimensions at all. Collection repeat now shines as a drop-in replacement for ngRepeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/docs/nightly/api/directive/collectionRepeat&quot;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Problems with the First Iteration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old collection repeat assumed that, in every case, any item in the list could be uniquely sized. This assumption required us to recalculate every single item&amp;#39;s width and height whenever the scroll view resized. This expensive operation caused unacceptable lag when loading or rotating the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we took another look at UITableView, we hit upon a better solution. UITableView accepts an &amp;#39;estimatedHeight&amp;#39; for every element in the list and uses that to estimate the size of the scrollView. Then, while the user scrolls down, each item&amp;#39;s dimensions are calculated on demand, and the size of the scrollView adjusts to reflect the actual dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We realized how much this could help performance and went into refactor mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Improvements in the New&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of requiring the user to input estimatedHeight, we compute the dimensions of the first element in the list with getComputedStyle() and use that for the estimatedHeight and estimatedWidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lets us calculate dimensions lazily. We estimate that &lt;code&gt;scrollView.height === estimatedHeight * items.length&lt;/code&gt; at the start, and as the user scrolls, we calculate the actual height of every element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also made some optimizations in the rendering of items. For example, we now batch DOM operations on items by setting cssText. We also now digest items entering items one frame after positioning them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the biggest optimization is in the calculation of dimensions. The new collection repeat has four possible &amp;#39;modes&amp;#39; it enters, the first being the most performant, and the last being the least performant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L731-L759&quot;&gt;Static&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L719-L729&quot;&gt;List&lt;/a&gt; Mode&lt;/strong&gt;: This mode is entered when the height is given as a constant or not given at all, and the width is 100%. Here, we assume the height of every element is equal to the estimatedHeight. The math for this mode is simple and easy because every item has the same dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L731-L759&quot;&gt;Static&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L706-L717&quot;&gt;Grid&lt;/a&gt; Mode&lt;/strong&gt;: Similar to static list mode, except there are multiple items per row. This is still simple because every item has the same dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L761-L917&quot;&gt;Dynamic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L719-L729&quot;&gt;List&lt;/a&gt; Mode&lt;/strong&gt;: This mode is entered when height is given as a dynamic expression, but width is still 100%. In this mode, every item potentially has a unique height. We get the computed height of the first item and use that to calculate the estimated size of the scrollView. Then, as the user scrolls, we lazily calculate the dimensions of the next items that should be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L761-L917&quot;&gt;Dynamic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L706-L717&quot;&gt;Grid&lt;/a&gt; Mode&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the most complicated mode and is entered when both height and width are dynamic expressions. It&amp;#39;s the same as dynamic list mode, except we also have to account for a potentially unique number of items appearing in each row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, each of the four modes can be entered in either &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L665-L684&quot;&gt;vertical&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/864b46aa818c3a230e77225ab704c16acbc93ac5/js/angular/directive/collectionRepeat.js#L684-L704&quot;&gt;horizontal&lt;/a&gt; scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the old repeater was that it was &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; in Dynamic Grid Mode and calculated all dimensions up front. This led to worse performance while scrolling, loading, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; resizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, even in the worst case of dynamic grid mode, collection repeat is more performant than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;More Performance Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest remaining opportunity for more performance gain is in the iOS browser’s rendering of images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you set the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; of an &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; on iOS to a non-cached value, there is a freeze of anywhere from 50-150ms--even on an iPhone 6. In our tests, an Android 4.1 device with images in collection repeat outperforms an iPhone 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images are very commonly used with collection repeat, and we change the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; of those images often as the user scrolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/e18e30fce379875c78e51fb6bf1445d9419153ce/js/workers/binaryToBase64.js&quot;&gt;creating a web worker&lt;/a&gt; that fetches the image, converts it, and sends its base64 representation back to the UI thread. The image is then set to this base64 representation as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/&quot;&gt;data-uri&lt;/a&gt;. This fixes half of the problem. If you set an &lt;code&gt;img src&lt;/code&gt; to a data-uri that has been set before, it instantly gets the rendered image from the cache and shows it without lag. However, the first time a unique data-uri is set, there is a similar delay to that of a a normal &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still an improvement from normal src, which just doesn&amp;#39;t cache well at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues/3194&quot;&gt;a few more tricks&lt;/a&gt; to improve iOS performance, and plan to release them as a simple-to-use solution soon. We welcome your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where We Are Now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new collection repeat is better than ever, and easier to use than ever. Give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Handling CORS issues in Ionic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve used &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ionic run&lt;/code&gt; with live reload and accessing external API endpoints, chances are you&amp;#39;ve run into some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/a&gt;
issues. They usually look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://api.ionic.com/endpoint.
No &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; header is present on the requested resource.
Origin &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;http://localhost:8100&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; is therefore not allowed access.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is CORS, and why is it a problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is CORS?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CORS = Cross origin resource sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; is the host you are currently viewing.
Since you&amp;#39;re at &lt;code&gt;http://ionicframework.com/blog/handling-cors-issues-in-ionic&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;ionicframework.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say we send an AJAX request to &lt;code&gt;http://cors.api.com/api&lt;/code&gt;,  your host origin will be specified by the Origin header that is automatically included for CORS requests by the browser. Since &lt;code&gt;ionicframework.com&lt;/code&gt; does not match the host of &lt;code&gt;api.com&lt;/code&gt;, our request from &lt;code&gt;ionicframework.com&lt;/code&gt; must ask the server for approval before we can access the resource, in the form of an HTTP OPTIONS request header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we get the error above, then we may not access the resource from the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look what your &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; will be when you&amp;#39;re running your app via &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ionic run&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;ionic run -l&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Running in the browser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when you run &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A local web server is started up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your browser is opened to point at the local server address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This starts you off looking at your app loaded in a browser on your computer with the address &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8100&lt;/code&gt; (if you chose localhost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;localhost:8100&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any AJAX request sent out to a host other than &lt;code&gt;localhost:8100&lt;/code&gt; will have &lt;code&gt;localhost:8100&lt;/code&gt; as its origin and thus will require a CORS preflight request to see if it can access the resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Running on a device&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when you run &lt;code&gt;ionic run&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your files for the app are copied to the device (or simulator).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The app runs, thus firing a browser on the phone/simulator to run the files that were copied over, something like: &lt;code&gt;file://some/path/www/index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; will not exist, since you are running off of a &lt;code&gt;file://&lt;/code&gt; URI; therefore, any request outwards will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; require a CORS request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Running on a device with livereload&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when you run &lt;code&gt;ionic run -l&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A local web server is started up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The app runs, thus firing a browser on the phone/simulator to run the files from the server &lt;code&gt;http://192.168.1.1:8100&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever your local IP address is).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.1:8100&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any AJAX request sent out to a host other than  &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.1:8100&lt;/code&gt; will require a CORS preflight request to see if it can access the resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dealing with CORS in Ionic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CORS is only an issue when we are running or testing our app when running &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ionic run -l&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to solve the issue: The first, and easier, solution is to just allow all origins from your API endpoint. However, we can&amp;#39;t always control the endpoint we are accessing. What we need, then, is a request that does not specify an &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do this by using a proxy server. Let&amp;#39;s look how the Ionic CLI provides
an easily configurable proxy server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Ionic CLI proxy server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick definition about proxies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;#39;d need to do to get around these CORS issues is have a proxy server that
will take our requests, issue a new request to the API endpoint, receive the response, and forward it back to our app so we can get around CORS issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ionic CLI introduced the ability to have a proxy server issue requests for you to get around any CORS issues you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the server is sending a fresh request to your destination, there will be no &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; and therefore, no CORS needed. It is important to note that the browser adds in the Origin header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setting up the proxy server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note, these are only needed for &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ionic run -l&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we will need to set up the proxies in our &lt;code&gt;ionic.project&lt;/code&gt; file. This will tell our Ionic server to listen to those paths and forward those requests on to the destination url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our app, we will need to replace our endpoint URLS to be set to the proxy server address for when we are running &lt;code&gt;serve&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;run -l&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make this a bit easier by using some gulp tasks using the replace module to swap out the URLs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggested method is to set up an Angular Constant to point at the API we&amp;#39;re trying to proxy out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the approach we will take below. We will also set up an Angular Service to use that API Endpoint to get data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setting up the proxy urls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say we want to access &lt;code&gt;http://cors.api.com/api&lt;/code&gt;, which is not allowing our origin from &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proxies settings contain two things: the &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; you use to access them on your local Ionic server, and the &lt;code&gt;proxyUrl&lt;/code&gt; you&amp;#39;d ultimately like to reach from the API call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up your &lt;code&gt;ionic.project&lt;/code&gt; file to be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;proxy-example&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;app_id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;proxies&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;path&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/api&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;proxyUrl&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://cors.api.com/api&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run your server with &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we specified above, when you access the ionic server at the path &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8100/api&lt;/code&gt;, it will proxy requests out to &lt;code&gt;http://cors.api.com/api&lt;/code&gt; on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, no CORS is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Set up Angular Constant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s quite easy to set up your API endpoints as Angular Constants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, we&amp;#39;ve specified the ApiEndpoint to be our proxied URL right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, we can use our production url as a constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;starter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ionic&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;starter.controllers&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;starter.services&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ApiEndpoint&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;http://localhost:8100/api&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// For the real endpoint, we&amp;#39;d use this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// .constant(&amp;#39;ApiEndpoint&amp;#39;, {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//  url: &amp;#39;http://cors.api.com/api&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// })&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, you can use the constant anywhere in your app, by including
&lt;code&gt;ApiEndpoint&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency, as shown below in the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setting up Angular Service&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ApiEndpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;/tasks&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Got some data: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getApiData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getApiData&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automating URL switches with Gulp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this process, we&amp;#39;ll need to modify our &lt;code&gt;gulpfile.js&lt;/code&gt; to add in two tasks to add our proxy url or remove our proxy url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by first installing the &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt; module - &lt;code&gt;npm install --save replace&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// `npm install --save replace`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;replace&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replaceFiles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;./www/js/app.js&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;add-proxy&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;regex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://cors.api.com/api&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://localhost:8100/api&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replaceFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;recursive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;silent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;remove-proxy&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;regex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://localhost:8100/api&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://cors.api.com/api&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replaceFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;recursive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;silent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial showed you one way to handle your CORS issues when running &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ionic run -l&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that it can be a hassle to swap out your API url endpoints when switching between &lt;code&gt;ionic serve&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ionic run -l&lt;/code&gt;. One thing that could be suggested is to have a gulp startup process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to handle the CORS problem is to ultimately ask your API provider to allow all hosts. However, this isn&amp;#39;t always an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Angular constant and the replace module will give us a happy medium, in which we can work around CORS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a solid example, take a look &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/driftyco/ionic-proxy-example&quot;&gt;at this sample project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is everything you&amp;#39;d need to access an API server that restricts CORS.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Interview with Jeremy Wilken, Author of Ionic in Action</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/ionic-in-action-header.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ionic in Action&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gnomeontherun&quot;&gt;Jeremy Wilken&lt;/a&gt;’s book &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicinaction.com&quot;&gt;Ionic in Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is being published by &lt;a href=&quot;http://manning.com/wilken&quot;&gt;Manning&lt;/a&gt; and will be released late this spring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the book is not yet in print, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicinaction.com&quot;&gt;get the early access version today&lt;/a&gt; (Save 42% with code ionic42) and give Jeremy direct feedback in the author forum, where he will respond to your posts himself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked with Jeremy about his background, his use of Ionic, and the process of writing the book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you tell us a little about yourself as a developer and writer?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many developers, I have always had an interest in tinkering and understanding the moving parts. I’ve been building websites since I was in junior high, and I gradually grew my skills to the point where I spent many years freelancing. More recently, I’ve joined larger scale projects and now work primarily as a front end engineer. I love working on usability and user experience. Becoming a developer and writer wasn’t my plan during my formal education (I’ve got a degree in the arts), but that is pretty common in our field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as being a writer, that part is somewhat new to me. Most of my writing was done in college, and while I did write quite a few papers then, the style is very different from the writing done for a technical book. I’ve worked pretty hard to improve my skills, and I am fairly proud of what I have written so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When did you start using Ionic, and what about it was compelling enough to you to write a book about it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with Ionic in early 2014, after it had been available for only a few months. My position at the time was investigating the feasibility of building a mobile app for internal employee use only, and, because our toolkit was primarily Node/AngularJS apps, Ionic fit into our skill set very well. I was able to build a prototype in a few hours and deploy it to a mobile device, which surprised me, compared to working with native development tools. (Granted, native development can be rapid, too, but you need to learn different skills.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always had a passion for helping others learn, whether by speaking at events or teaching in my work role, so writing a book was a natural interest of mine. The benefits and power of Ionic opened doors for me to build mobile apps with my current skill set, and I wanted to empower others the do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you talk about the process of writing this book?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a book is like a marathon. There’s a lot of ground to cover, and it takes a good cadence to reach the goal. The good thing is that while I’m the author, I have several editors who are able to help me articulate ideas, plan out concepts and examples, and review my work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general process starts with nailing an outline and working with a publisher to get the details ironed out. Then it’s a matter of meeting deadlines for chapters, getting them reviewed by editors, revising, getting more feedback, and so forth. The hardest part is getting the inspiration to write when I have the time blocked off. Writing is a form of art, and it takes the right mindset to get quality work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manning is the publisher for &lt;i&gt;Ionic in Action&lt;/i&gt;, and I have to say everyone I have worked with there has been extremely helpful and professional. They have helped to make the book a high-quality work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You built three Ionic apps during the writing process! Which UI elements did you use, and can you tell us more about the development process?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used nearly every Ionic component in the three apps I built for the book, so the book provides a good reference for using the components in an integrated manner.
The first is an app that a resort might use to provide value for their guests. It has the slide box, lists, cards, content containers, basic navigation, and other smaller elements.&lt;br&gt; 
Demo: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionic-in-action-chapter4.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;http://ionic-in-action-chapter4.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ionic-in-action/chapter4&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ionic-in-action/chapter4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is a bitcoin market app, which provides real-time currency rates for bitcoin. Some of the components it uses are pull to refresh, popovers, tabs, charts, advanced lists, and nested views.&lt;br&gt; 
Demo: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionic-in-action-chapter5.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;http://ionic-in-action-chapter5.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ionic-in-action/chapter5&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ionic-in-action/chapter5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is a weather app, with the ability to find locations and see the weather forecast. It leverages modals, custom scroll area (paginated scrolling), loading external data, side menus, a search view, and some other smaller elements.&lt;br&gt; 
Demo: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionic-in-action-chapter6.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;http://ionic-in-action-chapter6.herokuapp.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ionic-in-action/chapter6&quot;&gt;https://github.com/ionic-in-action/chapter6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demos were developed very carefully and actually took more time than writing the text did. I almost wish I could also have written about the process of building these apps, because while they look very straightforward to develop, for the book, it was a journey of writing and refactoring. I wanted to make sure the examples were not contrived or boring, but also not too complex. They needed to illustrate the key features I wanted to teach, so I would make the first prototype and then remove half of the code to simplify. I really hope they resonate with readers, and even if you don’t buy the book, you can still tinker with the samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you talk more about the functionality and technical aspects of the apps that you feel are unique, interesting, important, etc.?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think each app is unique and very quite robust. I’d say they are 80% ready to be deployed to an App Store, with some of the obvious missing pieces listed at the end of the chapter, as a challenge for readers to implement themselves. Considering the actual amount of code and the number of features, it should be pretty clear how much Ionic bolsters app development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AngularJS is a primary part of Ionic apps, and I’ve gone to great strides to provide an Angular primer, tips about Angular, and to structure the examples in a way that scales. There are too many bad and outdated examples of Angular code out there, and while it might be helpful for learning, it is a disservice to readers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could you talk about how you went about differentiating the app for different platforms? What did you do to align with the iOS platform, for example, vs. Android?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the examples leverage Ionic’s components almost exclusively, there isn’t much that I needed to do to support each platform in the examples. The beauty of Ionic components, such as the tabs component, is that Ionic will identify the platform and adapt the style appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, this topic is extremely important and is covered in the advanced topics chapter. When you start to design your own interface elements or modify the default ones, it is critical to preview your app in multiple platforms. The book covers techniques to allow you to target a platform, such as you want to use the action sheet in iOS and the popover in Android. Developers should spend time familiarizing themselves with the interface guidelines for both platforms and make decisions about what to use, because it ultimately helps users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What will Ionic users learn from this book?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People already using Ionic will be able to learn more about the entire ecosystem that surrounds Ionic, such as how to leverage Cordova and plugins; some of Ionic&amp;#39;s platform services, such as Ionic View; and how to level up Ionic development with advanced techniques and testing. I can&amp;#39;t stress enough how important tests are, but it is probably the most overlooked skill in software development. The book provides examples and insight into how to setup and write your own tests.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Built with Ionic: Viceversa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/viceversa-header.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ionic Logos&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://app.viceversa.io/&quot;&gt;Viceversa&lt;/a&gt; is a social decision-making app that lets anyone in the world help you make choices. Questions as simple as, &amp;quot;Where should we go for dinner?&amp;quot; or as complex as, &amp;quot;What should I say to resolve this situation?&amp;quot; can be crowd-sourced. Close friends and family members can share their opinions privately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ViceVersa team is comprised of CEO &lt;a href=&quot;http://fr.linkedin.com/in/viceversa&quot;&gt;Jonathan Widawski&lt;/a&gt;, the project leader, designer, and web developer; COO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/alexis-schechter/48/13a/a50&quot;&gt;Alexis Schechter&lt;/a&gt;, an iOs developer and marketing director; and CTO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-mary/72/918/711&quot;&gt;Thomas Mary&lt;/a&gt;, a backend developer and technical director. The team chose to build their iOS app using native code and their Android app with Ionic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt; 

&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin-left: -120px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 70px; width: 32%;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/img/blog/viceversa-left.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/viceversa-left.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ionic allowed us to create our app in no time, compared to our native iOS app,” says Widawski. “Since Thomas and I are huge Angular fans, the learning curve for Ionic was really smooth, and we got started quickly. Design-wise, we used almost everything Ionic provided, from CSS to JS utils, and tweaked most of them to respect the new material design guidelines and our own design.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time Widawski and Mary were developing the Android version of Viceversa, they were also building their website. “Ionic was the game changer in our development process,” says Widawski. “It gave us the opportunity to create a beautiful, AngularJS-based Android app using the resources we had: web development. Ionic allowed us to re-use what’s been done for our web app and simply copy and paste a lot of our previously completed work. It was delightful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widawski notes that Ionic’s recent updates demonstrate an effort to catch up with previous performance issues on Android. “Every recent update was a pleasant surprise in Android performance,” he says. “Design-wise, we decided to follow, as best as we could, the Material Design guidelines provided by Google. If you have the occasion to try both apps, you will see that they are very different: Every process was built with the platform in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Viceversa team is passionate about split testing, and leveraged it with the app. “We tried two radically different designs and interfaces because we want to know what works best,” says Widawski. “We plan to create tutorials on how to make most of the animation within our app and on how to improve performance on Android globally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widawski, a frontend developer who also has experience with PHP and the Laravel framework, adds, “There is an Ionic way of doing things. You don’t get lost; it is very well documented and up-to-date; and if you have any questions, the forum has one of the most active and helpful communities I’ve seen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary found Ionic to be straightforward and well-integrated with AngularJS. “There’s really little to no room for hesitation when coding,” he says. “That’s what we love about Angular, and that’s what we love about Ionic.” &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Displaying the Twitter Feed within Your Ionic App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post by Simon Reimler, software developer at arvato Bertelsmann, experienced with iOS, Android, AngularJS, Ionic and Python. Simon often writes about Ionic, web and mobile development. Read more on &lt;a href=&quot;http://devdactic.com/&quot;&gt;Simon&amp;#39;s Blog, DevDactic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the Twitter timeline of a user into your Ionic app can be a challenging task. Lucky for us, we can use the simple ngCordova OAuth wrapper previously &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/blog/oauth-ionic-ngcordova/&quot;&gt;described by Nic Raboy&lt;/a&gt; to solve the basic authentication. But what happens after the token authentication?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will take things one step further and show you how to authenticate with OAuth, make signed calls to the well documented &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public&quot;&gt;Twitter REST API&lt;/a&gt;, and parse the home timeline of a user inside your Ionic app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Set Up a Simple App&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll start with a simple blank Ionic app, install &lt;code&gt;ngCordova&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ngResource&lt;/code&gt; (needed for the REST calls later) via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bower.io/&quot;&gt;bower package manager&lt;/a&gt; and add a Cordova plugin we will need for the OAuth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ionic start devdactic-twitterfeed blank --appname “My Twitter Feed”
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;devdactic-twitterfeed
bower install angular-resource ngCordova --save
cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we need the jsSHA Library inside our project, because Twitter requires request signing using HMAC-SHA1. Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA&quot;&gt;jsSHA Github project&lt;/a&gt;, download it, and copy the &lt;code&gt;sha.js&lt;/code&gt; file from the archive into the &lt;code&gt;www/lib/&lt;/code&gt; folder of your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to include all these files inside our &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;. Make sure to add the ngCordova file before the cordova.js script tag that is already included! We also already included our services, and later, we will create and add a controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Before cordova.js --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;lib/sha.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;lib/angular-resource/angular-resource.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;lib/ngCordova/dist/ng-cordova.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- After cordova.js --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;js/controllers.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;js/services.js&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we must add the dependencies to our AngularJS module inside our &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;starter&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ionic&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ngResource&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ngCordova&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our app is now ready to connect with Twitter. The last thing we must do is to create an app on Twitter that will give us the credentials we need. Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Twitter Application Management&lt;/a&gt; page and create a simple app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creation, we need to change the callback URL of our Twitter app to &lt;em&gt;http://localhost/callback&lt;/em&gt;. As this is currently not possible via Twitter, make yourself a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/&quot;&gt;tiny URL&lt;/a&gt;, and insert that one instead.
Leave the created app for now; we will need to copy some keys from it in a later step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Writing a Twitter Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heart of our app will be the &lt;code&gt;TwitterService&lt;/code&gt;, which will handle our calls to the REST API and give us the data we need. Therefore, create a new file named &lt;code&gt;services.js&lt;/code&gt; next to the &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; file, and insert this (I will discuss the functions in detail afterwards):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;TwitterService&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$cordovaOauth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$cordovaOauthUtility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;twitterKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;STORAGE.TWITTER.KEY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clientId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;TwitterAppConsumerKey&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clientSecret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;TwitterAppConsumerSecret&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;storeUserToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;twitterKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getStoredToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;twitterKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTwitterSignature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromJson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getStoredToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;deferred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 6&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getHomeTimeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;home_tl_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/home_timeline.json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTwitterSignature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;home_tl_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;home_tl_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;storeUserToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;storeUserToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getStoredToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getStoredToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTwitterSignature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createTwitterSignature&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insert your personal &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Consumer Secret Key&lt;/code&gt; from the Twitter app you created in the preparation step. The Storage key is just for your localStorage, so change it to whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two functions are just for storing and retrieving the OAuth Token once the user is successfully authorized; nothing special here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;createTwitterSignature&lt;/code&gt; is one of the most important functions here, because this function takes care of the correct signing of our requests. When called, we give it the HTTP method, like &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;, and the URL from which we want to get the data. The function will then read the OAuth Token from localStorage and create an object with some more general stuff the Twitter REST API requires, like the Consumer Key and the OAuth Token. This object is then passed to the &lt;code&gt;$cordovaOauthUtility&lt;/code&gt;of ngCordova to create a correct authorization object, which will be set as the &lt;em&gt;authorization header&lt;/em&gt; of our request. For more detailed information about OAuth 1.0a, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nraboy.com/2014/11/understanding-request-signing-oauth-1-0a-providers/&quot;&gt;Nic Raboy&amp;#39;s blog post&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this function, we come to the returned object of our TwitterService. The &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; function will be called on our app startup. This function looks for a stored OAuth token that could be used for signing, but if it is not present, it will try to authorize the user with the help of &lt;code&gt;$cordovaOauth&lt;/code&gt;, where we again need the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.
This ngCordova wrapper will slide up a Twitter authorization form to the user, where the user must enter his/her credentials. Finally, we return a promise from this function to get informed about a correct/failed authorization in our controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;isAuthenticated&lt;/code&gt; function is very simple and only checks for a stored token. Keep in mind that users could revoke their permissions for an app, so here you might add a token verification check in a real app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally the &lt;code&gt;getHomeTimeline&lt;/code&gt; function can be called to retrieve our home timeline feed. Here, we create our signature for the request for the associated URL and return the request as a resource object. To learn more about this, check out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://devdactic.com/improving-rest-with-ngresource/&quot;&gt;ngResource blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Accessing the data from our Controller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have our service, we need to create the controller for our app, so go ahead and create a controllers.js. Now, open your created file, and insert this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;AppCtrl&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$ionicPlatform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TwitterService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;correctTimestring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showHomeTimeline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;home_timeline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TwitterService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getHomeTimeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doRefresh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showHomeTimeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$broadcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;scroll.refreshComplete&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 4&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$ionicPlatform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TwitterService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isAuthenticated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showHomeTimeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TwitterService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;showHomeTimeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our controller is rather simple now, as we have all our REST interaction logic inside our service. Anyway, let’s take a closer look at our functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our feed object from Twitter returns a quite unformatted date string, we need to convert the string to a more readable date to display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;showHomeTimeline&lt;/code&gt; function will fill our &lt;code&gt;home_timeline&lt;/code&gt; array with the feed data we get from our service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we will have a pull-to-refresh inside our view, we need a function to update the feeds array.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our platform is ready, we check if the user is already authenticated and initially fill the array. If not, we call our &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; from the service to show the login view to the user to perform the OAuth authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty much everything we need for a simple Twitter feed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Showing Feeds Inside Our View&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have a service to get the data from Twitter and a controller to hold our received data, we need an appropriate view to show the feeds in a Twitter-like style. For this, open the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; and replace the dummy body with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-app=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;starter&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;AppCtrl&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-pane&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-header-bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;bar-positive&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;My Twitter Feed&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-header-bar&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;has-header padding&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-refresher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on-refresh=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;doRefresh()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ion-refresher&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-show=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;home_timeline.length == 0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Loading tweets...&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-repeat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;entry in home_timeline&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;list card&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;item item-avatar&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;item item-body&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-bind-html=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;entry.text&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-if=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;entry.extended_entities&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;width: 100%;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-pane&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside our view, we first have the refresher, which allows us to use pull-to-refresh. Next, if our feed&amp;#39;s array is empty, we just display a little dummy text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main part is the &lt;code&gt;ng-repeat&lt;/code&gt; to iterate over the feed objects. Here, we make use of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/#cards&quot;&gt;Ionic cards&lt;/a&gt;, where we have the profile image of the user as an item-avatar, the username, our corrected time string in the top area, and inside the body of our card the text of the tweet. Additionally, if some media inside the feed data is set, we display the posted image below the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Final Words and Outlook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial shows a straightforward way to display Twitter feed data in an appropriate way inside your Ionic app. There are many more endpoints in the Twitter REST API, so make use of the newly created TwitterService and get the data you need!
Additionally, you could parse the feed data a bit more through a filter to make links clickable. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://devdactic.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; for an upcoming post about this topic!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Fifth Ionic Show is Live!</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;730&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sy9Rdt5XwdU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a small break after our last show, but we’ve all been working really hard for the last couple months and have a lot of exciting things to share. Most importantly, we want to give our community a huge shout-out for all your amazing support, hard work, and beautiful apps that have surpassed all of our expectations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ionic community has blown us away with everything we have been able to create in such a short period of time! It is because of the community that we have grown to one of the top 50 most popular open source projects in the world, with over 340,000 apps created across the globe and thousands more being created daily. In fact, we already have more groups around the world than we mentioned at the end of the show!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick breakdown of the show:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding Pull to Refresh</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post by Andrew McGivery, an application developer with a strong background in
Android, AngularJS, Ionic, C#, SQL, and front end development. Andrew writes often about Ionic and how to build great
hybrid apps. Read more on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcgivery.com/&quot;&gt;Andrew&amp;#39;s personal blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of social networks, the &amp;quot;feed&amp;quot; has become a popular design pattern, especially in mobile apps. The idea is to load in new items to the top of a feed by pulling down from the top of the list until you see a loading indicator, letting go, and watching as new items magically (not really) add themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ionic has an awesome directive that has undergone a redo fairly recently to accomplish exactly this. In this post, we&amp;#39;ll break down a basic example of using this directive, a list, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://randomuser.me/&quot;&gt;Random User API&lt;/a&gt; to see how to use the directive with example data (feel free to follow along &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/andrewmcgivery/pen/ZYyVgp&quot;&gt;on CodePen&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;ionRefresher (Pull to Refresh Directive)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ionic directive we are going to use is the &lt;code&gt;ion-refresher&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionRefresher/&quot;&gt;Official Documentation&lt;/a&gt;). The most basic usage is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-refresher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on-refresh=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;doRefresh()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ion-refresher&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;on-refresh&lt;/code&gt; should point to a &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt; function that gets the new data, updates a list, and then lets the refresher know it is done. This refresher should be above some kind of list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;View&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our example, we&amp;#39;ll be using the following view markup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-refresher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on-refresh=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;doRefresh()&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ion-refresher&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ion-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;item-avatar&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-repeat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;item in items&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    ##  
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-item&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ion-list&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which looks something like this, once rendered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mcgivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/list.png&quot; alt=&quot;rendered list&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that this list iterates over the &lt;code&gt;$scope.items&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;ng-repeat=&amp;quot;item in items&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Factory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our example, we&amp;#39;re going to be making a call to the Random User API to get some data to play with. To do this, we&amp;#39;ll create a factory that makes these API calls. This factory will have two methods: &lt;code&gt;GetFeed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GetNewUser&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;GetFeed&lt;/code&gt; will be called when our app loads to get the initial data, and the &lt;code&gt;GetNewUser&lt;/code&gt; will be called each time we do a pull to refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;PersonService&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://api.randomuser.me/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GetFeed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;?results=10&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GetNewUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;GetFeed&lt;/code&gt; call returns 10 results, and each call to &lt;code&gt;GetNewUser&lt;/code&gt; returns 1 result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Controller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our controller needs to do 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill the feed with the initial items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle the pull to refresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, to fill our feed, we&amp;#39;ll want to make a call to the PersonService and assign the result to the &lt;code&gt;$scope.items&lt;/code&gt; array:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;MyCtrl&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$timeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PersonService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PersonService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GetFeed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to handle the pull to refresh. Recall we configured our directive to call a &lt;code&gt;doRefresh&lt;/code&gt; function. We&amp;#39;ll need to define this function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doRefresh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this function, we should call the &lt;code&gt;GetNewUser&lt;/code&gt; function and add these items to the beginning of the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doRefresh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PersonService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GetNewUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll notice we are using the &lt;code&gt;array.concat&lt;/code&gt; function to add the items in. This is because &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; is an array, so we need to add the two arrays together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still need to do one final thing. We need to let the scroller know that we&amp;#39;re done loading in the new items, so it can hide the loading indicator. To do this, we need to broadcast the &lt;code&gt;scroll.refreshComplete&lt;/code&gt; event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doRefresh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PersonService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GetNewUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//Stop the ion-refresher from spinning&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$broadcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;scroll.refreshComplete&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its entirety, our controller looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;MyCtrl&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$timeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PersonService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PersonService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GetFeed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;doRefresh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PersonService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GetNewUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//Stop the ion-refresher from spinning&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$broadcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;scroll.refreshComplete&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the code above (full code on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/andrewmcgivery/pen/ZYyVgp/&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;), you can accomplish this common pull to refresh patten in your Ionic Apps. Questions? Feel free to comment below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Built with Ionic: Pacifica</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/pacifica-header.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ionic Logos&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkpacifica.com&quot;&gt;Pacifica&lt;/a&gt;, an app for stress, anxiety and worry, is built around quick, iterative activities that individuals can perform privately in order to cope, understand, and better control their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/beermann&quot;&gt;Dale Beermann&lt;/a&gt; and designer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrisgoettel&quot;&gt;Chris Goettel&lt;/a&gt; based the application on the well-known technique of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), in which therapists and their clients discuss emotions and tools with which to manage and overcome challenging feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression. Beermann and Goettel wanted to find a way for individuals to practice these techniques between therapy appointments or, in many cases, on their own, using their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found that the current implementations are simple mappings from typical workbook-based pen and paper exercises to a mobile device,” says Beermann. “However, workbooks themselves don’t fit into our normal routines. We knew we could do better.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt; 

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin-right: -160px; margin-bottom: 80px; width: 50%;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/img/blog/pacifica-preview-right.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img
src=&quot;/img/blog/pacifica-preview-right.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beermann and Goettel devised an app that would guide users through relaxation, thinking, wellness, and behavioral exercises, based on the tools of CBT. Users can open the app and practice these techniques anytime, anywhere, as often as they like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These are proven tools. I’ve personally dealt with anxiety most of my life, and CBT was the way out of the woods for me. The challenge then for me as a designer was distilling these tools into an engaging and empathetic app. I know first hand how debilitating and isolating anxiety can be. Pacifica is an extended hand to anyone suffering,” says Goettel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving to California, Beermann was an active member of the entrepreneurial community in Madison, where Drifty, Ionic’s parent company, is based. Beermann has known Drifty co-founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maxlynch&quot;&gt;Max Lynch&lt;/a&gt; for years, so when he started his most recent company, “Ionic was a natural choice,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beermann and Goettel, who both have backgrounds in web development, chose to build an HTML5 app because they wanted to be cross-platform from day one. “Building an HTML5 app gets you 95% of the way there,” says Beermann. “Choosing Ionic meant that we were productive immediately; there was no time wasted learning a new language or UI paradigm. We had working prototypes the first week we started programming.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin-left: -120px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 70px; width: 32%;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/img/blog/pacifica-android-left.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img
src=&quot;/img/blog/pacifica-android-left.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beermann and Goettel used most of the basic building blocks in Ionic to build their app: lists, modals, popups, drawers, overlays, and the Ionicons library. “You can’t quite tell, as we’ve customized most of the UI around it,” says Beerman, “but that was a lot of code that we didn’t have to write.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe that tools like Ionic or Bootstrap are incredibly important in the prototyping process,” adds Goettel. “They allow rapid proof-of-concept implementations that can be adapted for production quite easily. While these tools provide CSS layers over a broader framework, the CSS can be customized to your liking, giving you the benefit of a robust framework with the customizability a designer needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goettel chose a style that would work across platforms and wasn’t tied to the native UI of any single one, while incorporating design elements that fit correctly where appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are a couple things that we had to handle on the technology side to make a truly cross-platform application (Android sorely needs the HTML5 AudioContext), but we really wanted to stick with the same general look and feel everywhere,” says Beerman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t feel that we could ever be close to where we are today if there weren’t tools like Ionic available,” adds Beerman. “At best, we might have had a single platform ready for release if we were native, but with Ionic, we’re set to launch iOS and Android simultaneously.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find Pacifica in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pacificalabs.pacifica&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pacifica/id922968861?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; stores today!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Looking Sharp on the iPhone 6</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/iphones-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cordova on the iPhone 6&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Apple’s new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are on the scene, developers must consider new screen resolutions when building iOS apps. Ionic’s styles are fully responsive out of the box, so there’s no issue there. However, when testing an app on a shiny new iPhone 6, your app will look slightly blurry by default, displaying at the resolution of the iPhone 5 series and anti-aliasing the difference. That’s wasted pixels! There are two things you must do for your app to display full resolution on the iPhone 6 family of phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you may need to update the version of Cordova your project uses. The Ionic CLI makes this process a breeze. Simply run the following commands in a terminal window. Note that the first command may require sudo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;npm update -g ionic cordova
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/Development/myProjectDirectory
ionic platform update ios
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to add the appropriate splash screen. XCode will decide whether your app can take advantage of the full iPhone 6 and 6 Plus resolutions, based on whether appropriately sized splash screens have been added to your project. The Cordova update you just installed also includes the ability to specify splash screens via the confix.xml file, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;platform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ios&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;splash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;pathToImage/Default-568h@2x~iphone.png&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;640&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1136&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;splash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;pathToImage/Default-667h.png&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;750&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1334&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;splash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;pathToImage/Default-736h.png&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1242&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;2208&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
…
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ionic CLI makes that even simpler. As described in greater detail by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mhartington&quot;&gt;Mike Hartington&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/blog/automating-icons-and-splash-screens/&quot;&gt;Automating Icons and Splash Screens&lt;/a&gt;, the new &lt;code&gt;resources&lt;/code&gt; command makes it easy to create a splash screen. Simply put an image titled “splash” in your project’s resources directory (you may need to create one), and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ionic resources
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will automatically create iPhone 6 or 6 Plus-sized splash screens and update your config.xml. If you have images already prepared, just make sure you link to an image titled &lt;code&gt;Default-667h.png&lt;/code&gt;, with the dimensions 750px by 1334px for the iPhone 6, and &lt;code&gt;Default-736h.png&lt;/code&gt;, with the dimensions 1242px by 2208px for the iPhone 6+, and that they’ve been added to your project’s config.xml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Next time you run &lt;code&gt;ionic prepare&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ionic run&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;ionic build&lt;/code&gt;, the splash screens will be applied to your project, and your app can take full advantage of the new screen real estate offered to the new iPhone 6 series phones.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ionic Worldwide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/community-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ionic Logos&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our dedicated community helps make Ionic a great hybrid mobile app development ecosystem, for which we’re very grateful. One of the most exciting things we’ve seen happening over recent months is massive growth in our international community. Meetup groups have sprung up in cities around the world, and a few dedicated devs have committed to organizing Ionic groups for entire countries. Other users have presented Ionic in cities around the world. We are humbled and delighted by their enthusiasm and by the time and energy they dedicate to spreading the word about Ionic, and we’re so thrilled to watch our international user base grow in this organic way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;We provide official support to Ionic Meetup groups, starting with cool logos and icons designed by Drifty co-founder and designer extraordinaire Ben Sperry. Groups usually then create Twitter accounts and additional social media accounts as they see fit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We help them gain a following by retweeting (and posting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ionicframework&quot;&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/u/1/b/112280728135675018538/+Ionicframework/posts&quot;&gt;G+&lt;/a&gt;) event news, slides, videos, photos, and articles from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/ionicframework&quot;&gt;@ionicframework&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, prohibitive international costs and shipping time have unfortunately prevented us from providing swag, but that will be changing soon! We&amp;#39;ll keep you updated in the coming weeks about our new store. In the meantime, we&amp;#39;ve been encouraging our international Ionic groups to make their own Ionic stickers using the Logo Pack from the footer on our homepage or to order some from our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stickermule.com/user/1070630560/stickers&quot;&gt;StickerMule store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also created an &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/present-ionic/&quot;&gt;Ionic Presentation&lt;/a&gt; that many of our meetup organizers have found useful. Most of them tweak it slightly, and many translate it, but it provides a helpful scaffolding for an introductory presentation about Ionic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re always happy to answer any questions from our Meetup groups, and we enjoy being in regular touch with them. We’ve even been known to Skype in to say hello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a line-up of the current international Ionic groups (both countries and cities). &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:katie@drifty.com&quot;&gt;Email me&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested in organizing a group.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Ionic View App is Alive!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;showcase-image&quot; src=&quot;/img/blog/ionic-view-app-header.gif&quot; style=&quot;margin-top:-20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re excited to announce that &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ionic-view/id849930087?mt=8&quot;&gt;Ionic View for iOS&lt;/a&gt; is now in public beta! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alpha version has been live in the App Store for a while now, and after much updating and testing, we are confident it is ready to become a useful part of your Ionic development toolchain. We want to get View out to people as soon as possible, so it may feel somewhat spare at first, but there are still many exciting features in the pipeline! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt; 

&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin-left: -120px; margin-right: 40px; margin-top: -12px; width: 32%;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/img/blog/songhop-preview-left.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/ionic-view-preview-left.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Ionic View? How Does it Fit into My Workflow?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ionic View functions like your own mobile app portfolio. It allows you to easily view, share, and test the Ionic apps you are developing across devices - your own, a client’s, or the person in the cubicle next to you (and by cubicle, we mean the pool chair at your beachside resort).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ionic View integrates with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli&quot;&gt;Ionic command line&lt;/a&gt; to populate your app portfolio.  Once you’ve made sure to update your ionic-cli version to at least 1.3.2, starting and uploading an app is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ionic start myApp
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;myApp
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ionic upload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be prompted to login with your Ionic account, and upon doing so, your app will be visible in Ionic View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How it Works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin-right: -160px; margin-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px; width: 50%;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionicframework.com/img/blog/songhop-preview-right.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/ionic-view-preview-right.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View uses the Cordova &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser&quot;&gt;inAppBrowser plugin&lt;/a&gt; to launch your apps in their own separate WebView, so you can preview and test them. Normally, inAppBrowser only displays web content, but we might have hacked it a little to give apps access to the Cordova API and plugins. Ionic apps are hybrid apps for a reason, and a preview is not the same without plugin support! At the moment, plugin access is restricted to a specific subset of plugins, including GeoLocation, Keyboard, StatusBar, and BarcodeScanner, and we will be testing and adding many more in the coming weeks and months.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of all, View is an Ionic app! We hope it sets a good example of the native-quality mobile apps that are possible with Ionic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll continue to add support for new plugins as we review and test them. We’ll also be fixing some known &amp;quot;quirks&amp;quot; (you mean you didn’t want your app links to expire after five minutes of having the app open?) in the next few weeks, and we’re looking forward to adding features like auto updating and the ability to sync with a livereload server in the near future as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since View is an Ionic app, you may be wondering (or yelling), &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s the Android version?&amp;quot;. Have no fear, the Android version is on its way! We have been using Ionic View as a test for some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionic.io&quot;&gt;ionic.io&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; services that require custom plugins, and we started with iOS first. Instead of waiting for both versions, we decided to get View out to you as quickly as possible, so you can start using and enjoying it :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ionic-view/id849930087?mt=8&quot;&gt;Click here to download Ionic View&lt;/a&gt; from Apple&amp;#39;s App Store!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a plugin in your app that’s not supported yet? Having issues with the app? Feature request? Let us know on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.ionicframework.com/&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;, hit Tim up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/dopernicus&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, or open an issue on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-view-issues/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Crosswalk comes to Ionic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;showcase-image&quot; src=&quot;/img/blog/crosswalk-header.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-top:-20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ionic and Crosswalk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our latest CLI update, we’re excited to introduce the ability to package modern rendering engines within your app
for Cordova, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://crosswalk-project.org/&quot;&gt;Crosswalk for Android&lt;/a&gt;. Crosswalk provides Android
developers a bundled Chrome webview for their projects, resulting in better performance and predictability!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team is passionate about making hybrid mobile development awesome, and we’re so grateful to our committed,
enthusiastic community for helping us succeed in our mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started With Crosswalk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make sure you get the latest Ionic CLI, and then you can easily create an app, add the Android platform, and add
Crosswalk to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;New Project&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;npm install ionic
ionic start my_app
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;my_app
ionic browser add crosswalk
ionic run android
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Previous Ionic Project&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;npm install ionic
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;existing_app
ionic browser add crosswalk
ionic run android
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Specifying a version of Crosswalk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ionic browser list&lt;/code&gt; #Find the version of Crosswalk you want.
&lt;code&gt;ionic browser add crosswalk@10.39.235.15&lt;/code&gt;  #Install stable version 10.39.235.15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Building for separate architectures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Previously you needed an environment variable to build multiple architectures. Do to some changes on the underlying Cordova Android library, you no longer need to specify the environment variable to build multiple APKs. This should happen by default by running &lt;code&gt;ionic build android&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a device connected and run &lt;code&gt;ionic run android&lt;/code&gt;, it will auto detect that architecture type and only build and run for that device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Volatility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that running these steps it will alter your Android project, so you’ll want to use version control to
handle changes from Crosswalk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These commands should set you up with a custom Android build with Crosswalk. You can run the project as you normally
would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To confirm it was, in fact installed, open &lt;a href=&quot;chrome://inspect/#devices&quot;&gt;Chrome DevTools&lt;/a&gt; and confirm that it says &amp;quot;Chrome 37&amp;quot;
or greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d love to ask you to help out the cause by testing and giving feedback. This is your chance to help several open source projects at once: Cordova, Crosswalk, and Ionic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;10 Questions You May Ask:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve put together this Q &amp;amp; A to answer questions you might have about Crosswalk. Please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to contact us if you have questions that aren&amp;#39;t answered here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is Crosswalk?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crosswalk is an open source project that allows you to specify a version of Chrome to use as your web browser in Android.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The compiled app will have your code hosted inside of this Chrome webview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should I use Crosswalk?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Older versions of Android devices (4.0-4.3) use Android’s default browser, which has significantly less performance and standards compliance than modern Chrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Crosswalk gives you a specific and more performant version of Chrome to use on all Android devices, in order to reduce fluctuations and fragmentation among devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Crosswalk improve Cordova Android apps?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By designating a specific version of Chrome, you can skip the unexpected behavior from browsers that vary from device to device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved performance and ease of debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I expect, performance and size-wise?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In older Android Devices (4.0-4.3), you’ll see about a 10x improvement of both HTML/CSS rendering and JavaScript performance and CSS correctness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To bundle Chrome, you will see a small (~10-15MB) size increase in your Android Apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I try it out?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g ionic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I report errors?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you encounter any errors, please type &lt;code&gt;ionic info&lt;/code&gt; and paste that information to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli/issues&quot;&gt;Ionic CLI issues on github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I look for when testing?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved performance on older Android devices, with the ability to debug using Chrome DevTools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing any of the core Cordova plugins, such as Camera, GPS, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report weird behaviour while building or running the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report differences between using Crosswalk and not; for example, your splash screen no longer shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I debug with Crosswalk / Chrome?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire up Chrome DevTools and go to &lt;a href=&quot;chrome://inspect/#devices&quot;&gt;Chrome Inspect Devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the architectures for Android devices and why do they exist?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two main Architectures for Android - x86 and ARM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reason for the two are due to the device providers choosing to use a separate processor. With different processors, we’ll need to compile them separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Crosswalk, you may specify that you want two separate builds for x86 / Arm to keep your build size down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you make a single build, you will have to bundle both versions of Crosswalk (x86/Arm) and have a larger build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;size (~50-60 MB).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why the switch to Gradle for Android?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cordova Android team has decided to move away from Ant towards more of a Gradle-based build scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this upgrade, you may see alternative build messages from Gradle, instead of your normal Ant messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CLI Roadmap (tentative)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really important to us that we keep our users informed about what we&amp;#39;re working on. Here’s a roadmap that covers where we’ve been and where we’re going. Thanks for joining us on the journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1.3 Milestones (1/7/2014 - 1/12/2015)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crosswalk Browser introduction &amp;amp; installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Info command for environment-specific info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error reporting from CLI - helps us respond to errors faster and be proactive about errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual help commands - now the CLI gives more info about the individual commands &lt;code&gt;ionic help serve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1.3.1 Milestones (1/12/2015 -1/14/2015)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify a &lt;a href=&quot;https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk/android/stable/&quot;&gt;version of Crosswalk&lt;/a&gt; to use - &lt;code&gt;ionic browser add crosswalk@10.39.235.15&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See all the browsers available to install - &lt;code&gt;ionic browser list&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;em&gt;NOTE: Only stable releases are allowed for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug related to &lt;code&gt;ionic upload&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caching the Crosswalk downloads - once you’ve installed a version in a project, running &lt;code&gt;ionic browser add crosswalk&lt;/code&gt; will not re-download the webviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1.3.2 Milestones (1/14/2015 - 1/23/2015)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick fix for the &lt;code&gt;ionic upload&lt;/code&gt; command - fixed an issue with the cookies from the request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1.3.3 Milestones (1/23/2015 - onward)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a release option that removes unused files and minifies/uglifies to give you smaller builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the ability to specify Beta/Canary builds of Crosswalk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a way to release Android builds post 4.4 without Crosswalk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make using the CLI easier with tab complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
