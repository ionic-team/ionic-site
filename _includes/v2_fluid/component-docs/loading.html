The Loading component is an overlay that prevents user interaction while indicating activity.
By default, it shows a spinner based on the mode. It can also be passed any HTML content to
display with the spinner. You can hide or change the spinner to any of our predefined
spinners. The loading indicator is styled to display on top of other content even during
navigation.

Check out the [API docs](../api/components/loading/Loading) for more information.
