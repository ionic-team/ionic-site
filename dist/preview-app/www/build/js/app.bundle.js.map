represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n        if (!lib$es6$promise$utils$$isFunction(resolver)) {\n          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n        }\n\n        if (!(this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise)) {\n          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n        }\n\n        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver);\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n

When the\r\n * directive's `selector` matches\r\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n *\r\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n * arguments.\r\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n * depth-first order,\r\n *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n *\r\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n *\r\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n * the dependency was\r\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others.\r\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n *\r\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n * depth-first order. The\r\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n *\r\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n * delegate to the parent\r\n * injector.\r\n *\r\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n * element and the\r\n *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n * directives.\r\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n * child directives.\r\n *\r\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n * practice.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * Assume this HTML template:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n *       </div>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n *     </div>\r\n *   </div>\r\n * </div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Injectable()\r\n * class SomeService {\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'id: dependency'\r\n *   ]\r\n * })\r\n * class Dependency {\r\n *   id:string;\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### No injection\r\n *\r\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n * `MyDirective`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor() {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Component-level injection\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n * parents.\r\n *\r\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n * from the parent\r\n * component's injector.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n * parent element, or its parents.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n * have returned\r\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n *\r\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n * elements.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n *\r\n * ### Optional injection\r\n *\r\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n * resolved. If you\r\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n * with `@Optional()`.\r\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n * optional.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n * If none can be\r\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'text: tooltip'\r\n *   ],\r\n *   host: {\r\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n *   }\r\n * })\r\n * class Tooltip{\r\n *   text:string;\r\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n *     this.overlay.close();\r\n *     this.overlay = null;\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n * `tooltip` selector,\r\n * like so:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n * elements:\r\n *\r\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n * runtime.\r\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n * location in the current view\r\n * where these actions are performed.\r\n *\r\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n *\r\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n * equivalent.\r\n *\r\n * Thus,\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Expands in use to:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n * the directive\r\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n *\r\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n *\r\n * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\r\n * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n * })\r\n * export class Unless {\r\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n * and the result is:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n *     <li></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n *   <li></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n * the instantiated\r\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n */\r\nexports.Directive = decorators_1.makeDecorator(directives_2.DirectiveMetadata);\r\n// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

When the\r\n * directive's `selector` matches\r\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n *\r\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n * arguments.\r\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n * depth-first order,\r\n *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n *\r\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n *\r\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n * the dependency was\r\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others.\r\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n *\r\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n * depth-first order. The\r\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n *\r\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n * delegate to the parent\r\n * injector.\r\n *\r\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n * element and the\r\n *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n * directives.\r\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n * child directives.\r\n *\r\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n * practice.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * Assume this HTML template:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n *       </div>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n *     </div>\r\n *   </div>\r\n * </div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Injectable()\r\n * class SomeService {\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'id: dependency'\r\n *   ]\r\n * })\r\n * class Dependency {\r\n *   id:string;\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### No injection\r\n *\r\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n * `MyDirective`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor() {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Component-level injection\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n * parents.\r\n *\r\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n * from the parent\r\n * component's injector.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n * parent element, or its parents.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n * have returned\r\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n *\r\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n * elements.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n *\r\n * ### Optional injection\r\n *\r\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n * resolved. If you\r\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n * with `@Optional()`.\r\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n * optional.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n * If none can be\r\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'text: tooltip'\r\n *   ],\r\n *   host: {\r\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n *   }\r\n * })\r\n * class Tooltip{\r\n *   text:string;\r\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n *     this.overlay.close();\r\n *     this.overlay = null;\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n * `tooltip` selector,\r\n * like so:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n * elements:\r\n *\r\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n * runtime.\r\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n * location in the current view\r\n * where these actions are performed.\r\n *\r\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n *\r\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n * equivalent.\r\n *\r\n * Thus,\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Expands in use to:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n * the directive\r\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n *\r\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n *\r\n * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\r\n * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n * })\r\n * export class Unless {\r\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n * and the result is:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n *     <li></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n *   <li></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n * the instantiated\r\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n */\r\nvar DirectiveMetadata = (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(DirectiveMetadata, _super);\r\n    function DirectiveMetadata(_a) {\r\n        var _b = _a === void 0 ?

Angular application by explicitly specifying a component to use\r\n * as the root component for your application via the `bootstrap()` method.\r\n *\r\n * ## Simple Example\r\n *\r\n * Assuming this `index.html`:\r\n *\r\n * ```html\r\n * <html>\r\n *   <!-- load Angular script tags here. -->\r\n *   <body>\r\n *     <my-app>loading...</my-app>\r\n *   </body>\r\n * </html>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * An application is bootstrapped inside an existing browser DOM, typically `index.html`.\r\n * Unlike Angular 1, Angular 2 does not compile/process providers in `index.html`. This is\r\n * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\r\n * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\r\n * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\r\n * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\r\n *\r\n * We can use this script code:\r\n *\r\n * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\r\n *\r\n * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\r\n * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\r\n *\r\n *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\r\n *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\r\n *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\r\n *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\r\n *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\r\n *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\r\n *     domain instance.\r\n *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\r\n *     template into it.\r\n *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\r\n *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\r\n *     application.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\r\n *\r\n * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\r\n * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\r\n * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\r\n * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\r\n *\r\n * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple\r\n * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private\r\n * to that application.\r\n *\r\n * ## API\r\n *\r\n * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application. This is\r\n *   a reference to a `Type` which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.\r\n * - `customProviders`: An additional set of providers that can be added to the\r\n *   app injector to override default injection behavior.\r\n *\r\n * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ComponentRef}.\r\n */\r\nfunction bootstrap(appComponentType, customProviders) {\r\n    core_1.reflector.reflectionCapabilities = new reflection_capabilities_1.ReflectionCapabilities();\r\n    var appProviders = lang_1.isPresent(customProviders) ?

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\r\n  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\r\n  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\r\n  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\r\n\r\n  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\r\n  discussion of the approach used to shim.\r\n\r\n  Shimmed features:\r\n\r\n  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\r\n  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\r\n  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\r\n  document level stylesheet.\r\n  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\r\n\r\n    :host {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n    .foo {\r\n      background: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\r\n  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\r\n  this feature.\r\n\r\n  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\r\n  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\r\n  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\r\n\r\n  div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n  x-foo div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\r\n  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\r\n  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\r\n  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\r\n  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\r\n  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\r\n\r\n    div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n    div[x-foo] {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\r\n  selector added to them manually.\r\n\r\n  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\r\n  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\r\n  inside a shadowRoot.\r\n\r\n  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\r\n  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\r\n  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\r\n  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\r\n\r\n  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\r\n  specific to the scope in which they are working.\r\n\r\n  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\r\n  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\r\n  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\r\n  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\r\n  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\r\n\r\n    <style>\r\n      ::content(div) {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <content></content>\r\n\r\n  could become:\r\n\r\n    <style>\r\n      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\r\n      ::content(div) {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <div class=\"content-container\">\r\n      <content></content>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\r\n  declaration.

Things such as tab placement, icon changes, and view animations can be set here.\n *\n * ```ts\n * @App({\n *   template: `<ion-nav [root]=\"root\"></ion-nav>`\n *   config: {\n *     backButtonText: 'Go Back',\n *     iconMode: 'ios',\n *     modalEnter: 'modal-slide-in',\n *     modalLeave: 'modal-slide-out',\n *     tabbarPlacement: 'bottom',\n *     pageTransition: 'ios',\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * Config can be overwritting at multiple levels, allowing deeper configuration. Taking the example from earlier, we can override any setting we want based on a platform.\n * ```ts\n * @App({\n *   template: `<ion-nav [root]=\"root\"></ion-nav>`\n *   config: {\n *     tabbarPlacement: 'bottom',\n *     platforms: {\n *      ios: {\n *        tabbarPlacement: 'top',\n *      }\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * We could also configure these values at a component level. Take `tabbarPlacement`, we can configure this as a property on our `ion-tabs`.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-tabs tabbarPlacement=\"top\">\n *    <ion-tab tabTitle=\"Dash\" tabIcon=\"pulse\" [root]=\"tabRoot\"></ion-tab>\n *  </ion-tabs>\n * ```\n *\n * The property will override anything else set in the apps.\n *\n * The last way we could configure is through URL query strings. This is useful for testing while in the browser.\n * Simply add `?ionic<PROPERTYNAME>=<value>` to the url.\n *\n * ```bash\n * http://localhost:8100/?ionicTabbarPlacement=bottom\n * ```\n *\n * Custom values can be added to config, and looked up at a later point in time.\n *\n * ``` javascript\n * config.set('ios', 'favoriteColor', 'green');\n * // from any page in your app:\n * config.get('favoriteColor'); // 'green'\n * ```\n *\n *\n * A config value can come from anywhere and be anything, but there are a default set of values.\n *\n *\n * | Config property            | Default iOS Value      | Default MD Value          |\n * |----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n * | activator                  | highlight              | ripple                    |\n * | actionSheetEnter           | action-sheet-slide-in  | action-sheet-md-slide-in  |\n * | actionSheetLeave           | action-sheet-slide-out | action-sheet-md-slide-out |\n * | alertEnter                 | alert-pop-in           | alert-md-pop-in           |\n * | alertLeave                 | alert-pop-out          | alert-md-pop-out          |\n * | backButtonText             | Back                   |                           |\n * | backButtonIcon             | ion-ios-arrow-back     | ion-md-arrow-back         |\n * | iconMode                   | ios                    | md                        |\n * | menuType                   | reveal                 | overlay                   |\n * | modalEnter                 | modal-slide-in         | modal-md-slide-in         |\n * | modalLeave                 | modal-slide-out        | modal-md-slide-out        |\n * | pageTransition             | ios-transition         | md-transition             |\n * | pageTransitionDelay        | 16                     | 120                       |\n * | tabbarPlacement            | bottom                 | top                       |\n * | tabbarHighlight            |                        | top                       |\n * | tabSubPages                |                        | true                      |\n *\n**/\nvar Config = (function () {\n    function Config(config) {\n        this._c = {};\n        this._s = {};\n        this._s = config && util_1.isObject(config) && !util_1.isArray(config) ? config : {};\n    }\n    /**\n     * For setting and getting multiple config values\n     */\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @name settings()\n     * @description\n     */\n    Config.prototype.settings = function () {\n        var args = arguments;\n        switch (args.length) {\n            case 0:\n                return this._s;\n            case 1:\n                // settings({...})\n                this._s = args[0];\n                this._c = {}; // clear cache\n                break;\n            case 2:\n                // settings('ios', {...})\n                this._s.platforms = this._s.platforms || {};\n                this._s.platforms[args[0]] = args[1];\n                this._c = {}; // clear cache\n                break;\n        }\n        return this;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @name set\n     * @description\n     * Sets a single config value.\n     *\n     * @param {String} [platform] - The platform (either 'ios' or 'android') that the config value should apply to.

If no `id` is given then the menu\n * automatically receives an `id` created from the side it is on, such as\n * `leftMenu` or `rightMenu`. When using more than one menu it is always\n * recommended to give each menu a unique `id`. Additionally menuToggle and\n * menuClose directives should be given menu id values of their respective\n * menu.\n *\n * Menu supports two display styles: overlay, and reveal. Overlay\n * is the traditional Android drawer style, and Reveal is the traditional iOS\n * style. By default, Menu will adjust to the correct style for the platform,\n * but this can be overriden using the `type` property:\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu [content]=\"mycontent\" type=\"overlay\"></ion-menu>\n * ```\n *\n * To programatically interact with the menu, you first get the menu component.\n *\n * ```ts\n * @Page({\n * `<ion-menu [content]=\"mycontent\" id=\"leftMenu\"></ion-menu>\n * <ion-nav #mycontent [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>`\n * )}\n * export class MyClass{\n *  constructor(app: IonicApp){\n *    this.app = app;\n *    this.menu;\n *  }\n *\n *  // Wait until the page is ready\n *  ngAfterViewInit(){\n *    this.menu = this.app.getComponent('leftMenu');\n *  }\n *\n *  // Open the menu programatically\n *  openMenu(){\n *    this.menu.open();\n *  }\n *\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * If you want to use any of the APIs down below, make sure to grabe the menu component by it's ID\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/menu/\n *\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#menus Menu Component Docs}\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#navigation Navigation Component Docs}\n * @see {@link ../../nav/Nav Nav API Docs}\n *\n */\nvar Menu =

For example, by setting the icon name of `alarm`, on iOS the\n * icon will automatically apply `ios-alarm`, and on Material Design it will\n * automatically apply `md-alarm`. This allow the developer to write the\n * markup once, and let Ionic automatically apply the appropriate icon.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * <!-- automatically uses the correct \"star\" icon depending on the mode -->\n * <ion-icon name=\"star\"></ion-icon>\n *\n * <!-- explicity set the icon for each mode -->\n * <ion-icon ios=\"ios-home\" md=\"md-home\"></ion-icon>\n *\n * <!-- always use the same icon, no matter what the mode -->\n * <ion-icon name=\"ios-clock\"></ion-icon>\n * <ion-icon name=\"logo-twitter\"></ion-icon>\n * ```\n *\n * @property {string} [name] - Use the appropriate icon for the mode.\n * @property {string} [ios] - Explicitly set the icon to use on iOS.\n * @property {string} [md] - Explicitly set the icon to use on Android.\n * @property {boolean} [isActive] - Whether or not the icon has an \"active\"\n * appearance. On iOS an active icon is filled in or full appearance, and an\n * inactive icon on iOS will use an outlined version of the icon same icon.\n * Material Design icons do not change appearance depending if they're active\n * or not.

You use navigation controllers\n * to navigate to [pages](#creating_pages) in your app. At a basic level, a\n * navigation controller is an array of pages representing a particular history\n * (of a Tab for example). This array can be manipulated to navigate throughout\n * an app by pushing and popping pages or inserting and removing them at\n * arbitrary locations in history.\n *\n * The current page is the last one in the array, or the top of the stack if we\n * think of it that way.  [Pushing](#push) a new page onto the top of the\n * navigation stack causes the new page to be animated in, while [popping](#pop)\n * the current page will navigate to the previous page in the stack.\n *\n * Unless you are using a directive like [NavPush](../NavPush/), or need a\n * specific NavController, most times you will inject and use a reference to the\n * nearest NavController to manipulate the navigation stack.\n *\n * <h3 id=\"injecting_nav_controller\">Injecting NavController</h3>\n * Injecting NavController will always get you an instance of the nearest\n * NavController, regardless of whether it is a Tab or a Nav.\n *\n * Behind the scenes, when Ionic instantiates a new NavController, it creates an\n * injector with NavController bound to that instance (usually either a Nav or\n * Tab) and adds the injector to its own providers.  For more information on\n * providers and dependency injection, see [Providers and DI]().\n *\n * Instead, you can inject NavController and know that it is the correct\n * navigation controller for most situations (for more advanced situations, see\n * [Menu](../../Menu/Menu/) and [Tab](../../Tab/Tab/)).\n *\n * ```ts\n *  class MyComponent {\n *    constructor(nav: NavController) {\n *      this.nav = nav;\n *    }\n *  }\n * ```\n *\n * <h2 id=\"creating_pages\">Page creation</h2>\n * _For more information on the `@Page` decorator see the [@Page API\n * reference](../../../decorators/Page/)._\n *\n * Pages are created when they are added to the navigation stack.  For methods\n * like [push()](#push), the NavController takes any component class that is\n * decorated with `@Page` as its first argument.  The NavController then\n * compiles that component, adds it to the app and animates it into view.\n *\n * By default, pages are cached and left in the DOM if they are navigated away\n * from but still in the navigation stack (the exiting page on a `push()` for\n * example).  They are destroyed when removed from the navigation stack (on\n * [pop()](#pop) or [setRoot()](#setRoot)).\n *\n *\n * <h2 id=\"Lifecycle\">Lifecycle events</h2>\n * Lifecycle events are fired during various stages of navigation.  They can be\n * defined in any `@Page` decorated component class.\n *\n * ```ts\n * @Page({\n *   template: 'Hello World'\n * })\n * class HelloWorld {\n *   onPageLoaded() {\n *     console.log(\"I'm alive!\");\n *   }\n *   onPageWillLeave() {\n *     console.log(\"Looks like I'm about to leave :(\");\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n * - `onPageLoaded` - Runs when the page has loaded. This event only happens once per page being created and added to the DOM. If a page leaves but is cached, then this event will not fire again on a subsequent viewing. The `onPageLoaded` event is good place to put your setup code for the page.\n * - `onPageWillEnter` - Runs when the page is about to enter and become the active page.\n * - `onPageDidEnter` - Runs when the page has fully entered and is now the active page. This event will fire, whether it was the first load or a cached page.\n * - `onPageWillLeave` - Runs when the page is about to leave and no longer be the active page.\n * - `onPageDidLeave` - Runs when the page has finished leaving and is no longer the active page.\n * - `onPageWillUnload` - Runs when the page is about to be destroyed and have its elements removed.\n * - `onPageDidUnload` - Runs after the page has been destroyed and its elements have been removed.\n *\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#navigation Navigation Component Docs}\n */\nvar NavController = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NavController, _super);\n    function NavController(parent, app, config, keyboard, elementRef, _anchorName, _compiler, _viewManager, _zone, _renderer) {\n        _super.call(this, elementRef);\n        this.parent = parent;\n        this.app = app;\n        this.config = config;\n        this.keyboard = keyboard;\n        this._anchorName = _anchorName;\n        this._compiler = _compiler;\n        this._viewManager = _viewManager;\n        this._zone = _zone;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._transIds = 0;\n        this._init = false;\n        this._ids = -1;\n        this._sbTrans = null;\n        this._trnsTime = 0;\n        this._views = [];\n        this._trnsDelay = config.get('pageTransitionDelay');\n        this._sbEnabled = config.get('swipeBackEnabled') || false;\n        this._sbThreshold = config.get('swipeBackThreshold') || 40;\n        this.id = ++ctrlIds;\n        // build a new injector for child ViewControllers to use\n        this.providers = core_1.Injector.resolve([\n            core_1.provide(NavController, { useValue: this })\n        ]);\n    }\n    /**\n     * Set the root for the current navigation stack\n     * @param {Type} page  The name of the component you want to push on the navigation stack\n     * @param {object} [params={}] Any nav-params you want to pass along to the next view\n     * @param {object} [opts={}] Any options you want to use pass to transtion\n     * @returns {Promise} Returns a promise when done\n     */\n    NavController.prototype.setRoot = function (page, params, opts) {\n        if (params === void 0) { params = {}; }\n        if (opts === void 0) { opts = {}; }\n        return this.setPages([{ page: page, params: params }], opts);\n    };\n    /**\n     * You can set the views of the current navigation stack and navigate to the last view past\n     *\n     *\n     *```typescript\n     * import {Page, NavController} from 'ionic/ionic'\n     * import {Detail} from '../detail/detail'\n     * import {Info} from '../info/info'\n     *\n     *  export class Home {\n     *    constructor(nav: NavController) {\n     *      this.nav = nav;\n     *    }\n     *    setPages() {\n     *      this.nav.setPages([ {page: List}, {page: Detail}, {page:Info} ]);\n     *    }\n     *  }\n     *```\n     *\n     *\n     *In this example, we're giving the current nav stack an array of pages.

When users tap the select component, a\n * dialog will appear with all of the options in a large, easy to select list\n * for users.\n *\n * Under-the-hood the `ion-select` actually uses the\n * {@link ../../alert/Alert Alert API} to open up the overlay of options\n * which the user is presented with. Select can take numerous child\n * `ion-option` components. If `ion-option` is not given a `value` attribute\n * then it will use its text as the value.\n *\n * ### Single Value: Radio Buttons\n *\n * The standard `ion-select` component allows the user to select only one\n * option. When selecting only one option the alert overlay presents users with\n * a radio button styled list of options. The `ion-select` component's value\n * receives the value of the selected option's value.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Gender</ion-label>\n *   <ion-select [(ngModel)]=\"gender\">\n *     <ion-option value=\"f\" checked=\"true\">Female</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option value=\"m\">Male</ion-option>\n *   </ion-select>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Multiple Value: Checkboxes\n *\n * By adding the `multiple=\"true\"` attribute to `ion-select`, users are able\n * to select multiple options. When multiple options can be selected, the alert\n * overlay presents users with a checkbox styled list of options. The\n * `ion-select multiple=\"true\"` component's value receives an array of all the\n * selected option values. In the example below, because each option is not given\n * a `value`, then it'll use its text as the value instead.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Toppings</ion-label>\n *   <ion-select [(ngModel)]=\"toppings\" multiple=\"true\">\n *     <ion-option>Bacon</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Black Olives</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Extra Cheese</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Mushrooms</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Pepperoni</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Sausage</ion-option>\n *   </ion-select>\n * <ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Alert Buttons\n * By default, the two buttons read `Cancel` and `OK`. The each button's text\n * can be customized using the `cancelText` and `okText` attributes:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-select okText=\"Okay\" cancelText=\"Dismiss\">\n *   ...\n * </ion-select>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Alert Options\n *\n * Remember how `ion-select` is really just a wrapper to `Alert`?

An alert appears on top\n * of the app's content, and must be manually dismissed by the user before\n * they can resume interaction with the app.\n *\n * An alert is created from an array of `buttons` and optionally an array of\n * `inputs`. Each button includes properties for its `text`, and optionally a\n * `handler`. If a handler returns `false` then the alert will not be dismissed.\n * An alert can also optionally have a `title`, `subTitle` and `message`.\n *\n * All buttons will show up in the order they have been added to the `buttons`\n * array, from left to right. Note: The right most button (the last one in the\n * array) is the main button.\n *\n * Optionally, a `role` property can be added to a button, such as `cancel`.\n * If a `cancel` role is on one of the buttons, then if the alert is dismissed\n * by tapping the backdrop, then it will fire the handler from the button\n * with a cancel role.\n *\n * Alerts can also include inputs whos data can be passed back to the app.\n * Inputs can be used to prompt users for information.\n *\n * Its shorthand is to add all the alert's options from within the\n * `Alert.create(opts)` first argument. Otherwise the alert's instance\n * has methods to add options, such as `setTitle()` or `addButton()`.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * constructor(nav: NavController) {\n *   this.nav = nav;\n * }\n *\n * presentAlert() {\n *   let alert = Alert.create({\n *     title: 'Low battery',\n *     subTitle: '10% of battery remaining',\n *     buttons: ['Dismiss']\n *   });\n *   this.nav.present(alert);\n * }\n *\n * presentConfirm() {\n *   let alert = Alert.create({\n *     title: 'Confirm purchase',\n *     message: 'Do you want to buy this book?',\n *     buttons: [\n *       {\n *         text: 'Cancel',\n *         role: 'cancel',\n *         handler: () => {\n *           console.log('Cancel clicked');\n *         }\n *       },\n *       {\n *         text: 'Buy',\n *         handler: () => {\n *           console.log('Buy clicked');\n *         }\n *       }\n *     ]\n *   });\n *   this.nav.present(alert);\n * }\n *\n * presentPrompt() {\n *   let alert = Alert.create({\n *     title: 'Login',\n *     inputs: [\n *       {\n *         name: 'username',\n *         placeholder: 'Username'\n *       },\n *       {\n *         name: 'password',\n *         placeholder: 'Password',\n *         type: 'password'\n *       }\n *     ],\n *     buttons: [\n *       {\n *         text: 'Cancel',\n *         role: 'cancel',\n *         handler: data => {\n *           console.log('Cancel clicked');\n *         }\n *       },\n *       {\n *         text: 'Login',\n *         handler: data => {\n *           if (User.isValid(data.username, data.password)) {\n *             // logged in!\n *           } else {\n *             // invalid login\n *             return false;\n *           }\n *         }\n *       }\n *     ]\n *   });\n *   this.nav.present(alert);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n */\nvar Alert = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(Alert, _super);\n    function Alert(opts) {\n        if (opts === void 0) { opts = {}; }\n        opts.inputs = opts.inputs || [];\n        opts.buttons = opts.buttons || [];\n        _super.call(this, AlertCmp, opts);\n        this.viewType = 'alert';\n    }\n    /**\n    * @private\n    */\n    Alert.prototype.getTransitionName = function (direction) {\n        var key = (direction === 'back' ?

As a subclass of NavController\n * you use it to navigate to pages in your app and manipulate the navigation stack.\n * Nav automatically animates transitions between pages for you.\n *\n * For more information on using navigation controllers like Nav or [Tab](../../Tabs/Tab/),\n * take a look at the [NavController API reference](../NavController/).\n *\n * You must set a root page (where page is any [@Page](../../config/Page/)\n * component) to be loaded initially by any Nav you create, using\n * the 'root' property:\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {GettingStartedPage} from 'getting-started';\n * @App({\n *   template: `<ion-nav [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>`\n * })\n * class MyApp {\n *   constructor(){\n *     this.rootPage = GettingStartedPage;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * <h2 id=\"back_navigation\">Back navigation</h2>\n * If a [page](../NavController/#creating_pages) you navigate to has a [NavBar](../NavBar/),\n * Nav will automatically add a back button to it if there is a page\n * before the one you are navigating to in the navigation stack.\n *\n * Additionally, specifying the `swipe-back-enabled` property will allow you to\n * swipe to go back:\n * ```html\n * <ion-nav swipe-back-enabled=\"false\" [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * Here is a diagram of how Nav animates smoothly between pages:\n *\n * <div class=\"highlight less-margin\">\n *

It appears on top of the app's content, and must be manually\n * dismissed by the user before they can resume interaction with the app.\n * Dangerous (destructive) options are made obvious. There are easy\n * ways to cancel out of the action sheet, such as tapping the backdrop or\n * hitting the escape key on desktop.\n *\n * An action sheet is created from an array of `buttons`, with each button\n * including properties for its `text`, and optionally a `handler` and `role`.\n * If a handler returns `false` then the action sheet will not be dismissed. An\n * action sheet can also optionally have a `title` and a `subTitle`.\n *\n * A button's `role` property can either be `destructive` or `cancel`. Buttons\n * without a role property will have a default look for its platform. Buttons\n * with the `cancel` role will always load as the bottom button, no matter where\n * it shows up in the array. All other buttons will show up in the order they\n * have been added to the `buttons` array. Note: We recommend that `destructive`\n * buttons show be the first button in the array, making it the button on top.\n * Additionally, if the action sheet is dismissed by tapping the backdrop, then\n * it will fire the handler from the button with the cancel role.\n *\n * Its shorthand is to add all the action sheet's options from within the\n * `ActionSheet.create(opts)` first argument.
