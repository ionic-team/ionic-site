Alerts are a great way to offer the user the ability to choose a specific action or list of actions. They also can provide the user with important information, or require them to make a decision (or multiple decisions).

From a UI perspective, you can think of Alerts as a type of “floating” modal, that covers only a portion of the screen. This means Alerts should only be used for quick actions like password verification, small app notifications, or quick options. More in depth user flows should be reserved for full screen ​[Modals](#modals)​.

Alerts are quite flexible, and can easily be customized. Check out the [API docs](../api/components/alert/Alert) for more information.

<h3 class="section-nav" id="alerts">Basic Usage:</h3>

<a target="_blank" class="component-doc-demo" href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-preview-app/tree/master/app/pages/alerts/basic">
  Demo Source
</a>

Basic Alerts are generally used to notify the user about new information (a change in the app, a new feature), an urgent situation that requires acknowledgement, or as a confirmation to the user that an action was successful or not.

```
  doAlert() {
    let alert = Alert.create({
      title: 'New Friend!',
      subTitle: 'Your friend, Obi wan Kenobi, just accepted your friend request!',
      buttons: ['Ok']
    });
    this.nav.present(alert);
  }
```

<h3 class="section-nav" id="alert-prompt">Prompt Alerts</h3>

<a target="_blank" class="component-doc-demo" href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-preview-app/tree/master/app/pages/alerts/prompt">
  Demo Source
</a>

Prompts offer the user a way to input data or information. For example, often times Prompt Alerts will be used to ask the user for password confirmation as a means of security before moving forward in an app’s ux flow.

```
    let prompt = Alert.create({
      title: 'Login',
      body: "Enter a name for this new album you're so keen on adding",
      inputs: [
        {
          name: 'title',
          placeholder: 'Title'
        },
      ],
      buttons: [
        {
          text: 'Cancel',
          handler: data => {
            console.log('Cancel clicked');
          }
        },
        {
          text: 'Save',
          handler: data => {
            console.log('Saved clicked');
          }
        }
      ]
    });
```

<h3 class="section-nav" id="alert-confirm">Confirmation Alerts</h3>

<a target="_blank" class="component-doc-demo" href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-preview-app/tree/master/app/pages/alerts/confirm">
  Demo Source
</a>

Confirmation Alerts are used when it is required that the user explicitly confirms a particular choice before progressing forward in the app. A common example of the Confirmation Alert is checking to make sure a user wants to delete or remove a contact from their address book.

```
    let confirm = Alert.create({
      title: 'Use this lightsaber?',
      body: 'Do you agree to use this lightsaber to do good across the intergalactic galaxy?',
      buttons: [
        {
          text: 'Disagree',
          handler: () => {
            console.log('Disagree clicked');
          }
        },
        {
          text: 'Agree',
          handler: () => {
            console.log('Agree clicked');
          }
        }
      ]
    });
```


<h3 class="section-nav" id="alert-radio">Radio</h3>

<a target="_blank" class="component-doc-demo" href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-preview-app/tree/master/app/pages/alerts/radio">
  Demo Source
</a>

Radio Alerts are simply another type of Confirmation Alert, but use the [Radio](http://http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/components/#radio) component to offer several choices. They offer the user a set of options to choose from, but are allowed to only make one final selection before continuing forward.

```
  doRadio() {
    let alert = Alert.create();
    alert.setTitle('Lightsaber color');

    alert.addInput({
      type: 'radio',
      label: 'Blue',
      value: 'blue',
      checked: true
    });

    alert.addButton('Cancel');
    alert.addButton({
      text: 'Ok',
      handler: data => {
        this.testRadioOpen = false;
        this.testRadioResult = data;
      }
    });
```
