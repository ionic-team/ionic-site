## GUIDELINES

When in doubt, keep pull requests small. Just a few related changes and nothing else. Separate different features or changes into different PRs to make it easy to merge.

Always use two spaces and no tabs for indentation.

## Structure

Note that `/docs/api`, `/docs/v2/api`, and anything in `dist` is automatically generated. The v1 and v2 docs are generated by dgeni on every commit, using inline code comments.

This site's humble beginnings started as a Github Pages site, and much of that core structure remains. Now it is a tiny Node.js/Express app that lives on a Heroku server. The Node.js app for the most part serves static html files that have been generated by Jekyll.

On every commit, CircleCI runs `jekyll build` and commits the contents of `_site` to this repo's `production` branch. Heroku tracks that branch and automatically deploys it to [ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com](http://ionic-site-staging.herokuapp.com).

This project is in some ways multiple sites in one and has multiple build/compile processes. `gulp watch` will run all of these, and should meet most style and JS processing needs.

v1 styles are in `scss` and output to `css/site.css`. v2 styles are in `_scss` and output to `css/v2.css`.

v2 images and JS are preprocessed and optimized. Their working directories should be `_img` and `_js` respectively.

Per Jekyll conventions, any directory starting with an underscore does not get copied to production.
