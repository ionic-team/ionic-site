 Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n\t      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n\t      Terminology\n\t      -----------\n\n\t      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n\t      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n\t      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n\t      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t      itself fulfill.\n\n\n\t      Basic Usage:\n\t      ------------\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t        // on success\n\t        resolve(value);\n\n\t        // on failure\n\t        reject(reason);\n\t      });\n\n\t      promise.then(function(value) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Advanced Usage:\n\t      ---------------\n\n\t      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      function getJSON(url) {\n\t        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n\t          xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t          xhr.send();\n\n\t          function handler() {\n\t            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t              if (this.status === 200) {\n\t                resolve(this.response);\n\t              } else {\n\t                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          };\n\t        });\n\t      }\n\n\t      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      Promise.all([\n\t        getJSON('/posts'),\n\t        getJSON('/comments')\n\t      ]).then(function(values){\n\t        values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n\t        return values;\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      @class Promise\n\t      @param {function} resolver\n\t      Useful for tooling.\n\t      @constructor\n\t    */\n\t    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n\t      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n\t      this._state = undefined;\n\t      this._result = undefined;\n\t      this._subscribers = [];\n\n\t      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n\t        if (!lib$es6$promise$utils$$isFunction(resolver)) {\n\t          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n\t        }\n\n\t        if (!(this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise)) {\n\t          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n\t        }\n\n\t        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver);\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n\t      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n\t    /**\n\t      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function(user){\n\t        // user is available\n\t      }, function(reason){\n\t        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Chaining\n\t      --------\n\n\t      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n\t      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n\t      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t      }).then(function (comments) {\n\t        // The user's comments are now available\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t      }).then(function (comments) {\n\t        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t      }, function (reason) {\n\t        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Simple Example\n\t      --------------\n\n\t      Synchronous Example\n\n\t      ```javascript\n\t      var result;\n\n\t      try {\n\t        result = findResult();\n\t        // success\n\t      } catch(reason) {\n\t        // failure\n\t      }\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Errback Example\n\n\t      ```js\n\t      findResult(function(result, err){\n\t        if (err) {\n\t          // failure\n\t        } else {\n\t          // success\n\t        }\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Promise Example;\n\n\t      ```javascript\n\t      findResult().then(function(result){\n\t        // success\n\t      }, function(reason){\n\t        // failure\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Advanced Example\n\t      --------------\n\n\t      Synchronous Example\n\n\t      ```javascript\n\t      var author, books;\n\n\t      try {\n\t        author = findAuthor();\n\t        books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n\t        // success\n\t      } catch(reason) {\n\t        // failure\n\t      }\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Errback Example\n\n\t      ```js\n\n\t      function foundBooks(books) {\n\n\t      }\n\n\t      function failure(reason) {\n\n\t      }\n\n\t      findAuthor(function(author, err){\n\t        if (err) {\n\t          failure(err);\n\t          // failure\n\t        } else {\n\t          try {\n\t            findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n\t              if (err) {\n\t                failure(err);\n\t              } else {\n\t                try {\n\t                  foundBooks(books);\n\t                } catch(reason) {\n\t                  failure(reason);\n\t                }\n\t              }\n\t            });\n\t          } catch(error) {\n\t            failure(err);\n\t          }\n\t          // success\n\t        }\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      Promise Example;\n\n\t      ```javascript\n\t      findAuthor().\n\t        then(findBooksByAuthor).\n\t        then(function(books){\n\t          // found books\n\t      }).catch(function(reason){\n\t        // something went wrong\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\n\t      @method then\n\t      @param {Function} onFulfilled\n\t      @param {Function} onRejected\n\t      Useful for tooling.\n\t      @return {Promise}\n\t    */\n\t      then: function(onFulfillment, onRejection) {\n\t        var parent = this;\n\t        var state = parent._state;\n\n\t        if (state === lib$es6$promise$$internal$$FULFILLED && !onFulfillment || state === lib$es6$promise$$internal$$REJECTED && !onRejection) {\n\t          return this;\n\t        }\n\n\t        var child = new this.constructor(lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop);\n\t        var result = parent._result;\n\n\t        if (state) {\n\t          var callback = arguments[state -

When the\r\n * directive's `selector` matches\r\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n *\r\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n * arguments.\r\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n * depth-first order,\r\n *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n *\r\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n *\r\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n * the dependency was\r\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others.\r\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n *\r\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n * depth-first order. The\r\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n *\r\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n * delegate to the parent\r\n * injector.\r\n *\r\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n * element and the\r\n *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n * directives.\r\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n * child directives.\r\n *\r\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n * practice.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * Assume this HTML template:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n *       </div>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n *     </div>\r\n *   </div>\r\n * </div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Injectable()\r\n * class SomeService {\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'id: dependency'\r\n *   ]\r\n * })\r\n * class Dependency {\r\n *   id:string;\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### No injection\r\n *\r\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n * `MyDirective`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor() {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Component-level injection\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n * parents.\r\n *\r\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n * from the parent\r\n * component's injector.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n * parent element, or its parents.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n * have returned\r\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n *\r\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n * elements.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n *\r\n * ### Optional injection\r\n *\r\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n * resolved. If you\r\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n * with `@Optional()`.\r\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n * optional.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n * If none can be\r\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'text: tooltip'\r\n *   ],\r\n *   host: {\r\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n *   }\r\n * })\r\n * class Tooltip{\r\n *   text:string;\r\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n *     this.overlay.close();\r\n *     this.overlay = null;\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n * `tooltip` selector,\r\n * like so:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n * elements:\r\n *\r\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n * runtime.\r\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n * location in the current view\r\n * where these actions are performed.\r\n *\r\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n *\r\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n * equivalent.\r\n *\r\n * Thus,\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Expands in use to:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n * the directive\r\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n *\r\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n *\r\n * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\r\n * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n * })\r\n * export class Unless {\r\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n * and the result is:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n *     <li></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n *   <li></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n * the instantiated\r\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n */\r\nexports.Directive = decorators_1.makeDecorator(directives_2.DirectiveMetadata);\r\n// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

When the\r\n * directive's `selector` matches\r\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n *\r\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n * arguments.\r\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n * depth-first order,\r\n *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n *\r\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n *\r\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n * the dependency was\r\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others.\r\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n *\r\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n * depth-first order. The\r\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n *\r\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n * delegate to the parent\r\n * injector.\r\n *\r\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n * element and the\r\n *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n * directives.\r\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n * child directives.\r\n *\r\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n * practice.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * Assume this HTML template:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n *       </div>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n *     </div>\r\n *   </div>\r\n * </div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Injectable()\r\n * class SomeService {\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'id: dependency'\r\n *   ]\r\n * })\r\n * class Dependency {\r\n *   id:string;\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### No injection\r\n *\r\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n * `MyDirective`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor() {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Component-level injection\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n * parents.\r\n *\r\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n * from the parent\r\n * component's injector.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n * parent element, or its parents.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n * have returned\r\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n *\r\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n * elements.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n *\r\n * ### Optional injection\r\n *\r\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n * resolved. If you\r\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n * with `@Optional()`.\r\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n * optional.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n * If none can be\r\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'text: tooltip'\r\n *   ],\r\n *   host: {\r\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n *   }\r\n * })\r\n * class Tooltip{\r\n *   text:string;\r\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n *     this.overlay.close();\r\n *     this.overlay = null;\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n * `tooltip` selector,\r\n * like so:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n * elements:\r\n *\r\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n * runtime.\r\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n * location in the current view\r\n * where these actions are performed.\r\n *\r\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n *\r\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n * equivalent.\r\n *\r\n * Thus,\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Expands in use to:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n * the directive\r\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n *\r\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n *\r\n * When the directive class implements some {@link angular2/lifecycle_hooks} the callbacks are\r\n * called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n * })\r\n * export class Unless {\r\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n * and the result is:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n *     <li></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n *   <li></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n * the instantiated\r\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n */\r\nvar DirectiveMetadata = (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(DirectiveMetadata, _super);\r\n    function DirectiveMetadata(_a) {\r\n        var _b = _a === void 0 ?

This is\r\n * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\r\n * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\r\n * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\r\n * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\r\n *\r\n * We can use this script code:\r\n *\r\n * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\r\n *\r\n * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\r\n * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\r\n *\r\n *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\r\n *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\r\n *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\r\n *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\r\n *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\r\n *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\r\n *     domain instance.\r\n *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\r\n *     template into it.\r\n *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\r\n *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\r\n *     application.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\r\n *\r\n * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\r\n * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\r\n * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\r\n * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\r\n *\r\n * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple\r\n * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private\r\n * to that application.\r\n *\r\n * ## API\r\n *\r\n * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application. This is\r\n *   a reference to a `Type` which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.\r\n * - `customProviders`: An additional set of providers that can be added to the\r\n *   app injector to override default injection behavior.\r\n *\r\n * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ComponentRef}.\r\n */\r\nfunction bootstrap(appComponentType, customProviders) {\r\n    core_1.reflector.reflectionCapabilities = new reflection_capabilities_1.ReflectionCapabilities();\r\n    var appProviders = lang_1.isPresent(customProviders) ?

The context for\r\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\r\n * to the current item from the iterable.\r\n *\r\n * # Local Variables\r\n *\r\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\r\n *\r\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\r\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\r\n *   iteration.\r\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\r\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\r\n *\r\n * # Change Propagation\r\n *\r\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\r\n *\r\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\r\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\r\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\r\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\r\n *\r\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\r\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\r\n * controls\r\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\r\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\r\n * as user input.\r\n *\r\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\r\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\r\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\r\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\r\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\r\n * be avoided if possible.\r\n *\r\n * # Syntax\r\n *\r\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"#item of items; #i = index\">...</li>`\r\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor #item of items;

Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\r\n * the `ControlArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\r\n * as broken change detection.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/23DESOpbNnBpBHZt1BR4?p=preview))\r\n */\r\nvar ControlArray = (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(ControlArray, _super);\r\n    function ControlArray(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\r\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\r\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\r\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\r\n        this.controls = controls;\r\n        this._initObservables();\r\n        this._setParentForControls();\r\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\r\n    }\r\n    /**\r\n     * Get the {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\r\n     */\r\n    ControlArray.prototype.at = function (index) { return this.controls[index]; };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\r\n     */\r\n    ControlArray.prototype.push = function (control) {\r\n        this.controls.push(control);\r\n        control.setParent(this);\r\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\r\n     */\r\n    ControlArray.prototype.insert = function (index, control) {\r\n        collection_1.ListWrapper.insert(this.controls, index, control);\r\n        control.setParent(this);\r\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\r\n     */\r\n    ControlArray.prototype.removeAt = function (index) {\r\n        collection_1.ListWrapper.removeAt(this.controls, index);\r\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\r\n    };\r\n    Object.defineProperty(ControlArray.prototype, \"length\", {\r\n        /**\r\n         * Length of the control array.\r\n         */\r\n        get: function () { return this.controls.length; },\r\n        enumerable: true,\r\n        configurable: true\r\n    });\r\n    /** @internal */\r\n    ControlArray.prototype._updateValue = function () { this._value = this.controls.map(function (control) { return control.value; }); };\r\n    /** @internal */\r\n    ControlArray.prototype._anyControlsHaveStatus = function (status) {\r\n        return this.controls.some(function (c) { return c.status == status; });\r\n    };\r\n    /** @internal */\r\n    ControlArray.prototype._setParentForControls = function () {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        this.controls.forEach(function (control) { control.setParent(_this); });\r\n    };\r\n    return ControlArray;\r\n})(AbstractControl);\r\nexports.ControlArray = ControlArray;\r\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/angular2/src/common/forms/model.js\n ** module id = 192\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';var lang_1 = require('angular2/src/facade/lang');\r\nvar exceptions_1 = require('angular2/src/facade/exceptions');\r\n/**\r\n * Base class for control directives.\r\n *\r\n * Only used internally in the forms module.\r\n */\r\nvar AbstractControlDirective = (function () {\r\n    function AbstractControlDirective() {\r\n    }\r\n    Object.defineProperty(AbstractControlDirective.prototype, \"control\", {\r\n        get: function () { return exceptions_1.unimplemented(); },\r\n        enumerable: true,\r\n        configurable: true\r\n    });\r\n    Object.defineProperty(AbstractControlDirective.prototype, \"value\", {\r\n        get: function () { return lang_1.isPresent(this.control) ?

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\r\n  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\r\n  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\r\n  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\r\n\r\n  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\r\n  discussion of the approach used to shim.\r\n\r\n  Shimmed features:\r\n\r\n  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\r\n  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\r\n  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\r\n  document level stylesheet.\r\n  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\r\n\r\n    :host {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n    .foo {\r\n      background: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  * encapsultion: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\r\n  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\r\n  this feature.\r\n\r\n  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\r\n  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\r\n  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\r\n\r\n  div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n  x-foo div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\r\n  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\r\n  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\r\n  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\r\n  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\r\n  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\r\n\r\n    div {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  becomes:\r\n\r\n    div[x-foo] {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\r\n  selector added to them manually.\r\n\r\n  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\r\n  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\r\n  inside a shadowRoot.\r\n\r\n  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\r\n  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\r\n  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\r\n  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\r\n\r\n  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\r\n  specific to the scope in which they are working.\r\n\r\n  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\r\n  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\r\n  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\r\n  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\r\n  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\r\n\r\n    <style>\r\n      ::content(div) {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <content></content>\r\n\r\n  could become:\r\n\r\n    <style>\r\n      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\r\n      ::content(div) {\r\n        background: red;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n    <div class=\"content-container\">\r\n      <content></content>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\r\n  declaration.

Note that a **menu is a sibling to its content**.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu [content]=\"mycontent\">\n *   <ion-content>\n *     <ion-list>\n *     ...\n *     </ion-list>\n *   </ion-content>\n * </ion-menu>\n *\n * <ion-nav #mycontent [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * By default, Menus are on the left, but this can be overridden with the `side`\n * property:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu side=\"right\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Programmatic Interaction\n *\n * To programmatically interact with any menu, you can inject the `MenuController`\n * provider into any component or directive. This makes it easy get ahold of and\n * control the correct menu instance. By default Ionic will find the app's menu\n * without requiring a menu ID.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import{Page, MenuController} from 'ionic-angular';\n * @Page({...})\n * export class MyPage {\n *  constructor(menu: MenuController) {\n *    this.menu = menu;\n *  }\n *\n *  openMenu() {\n *    this.menu.open();\n *  }\n *\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Note that if you want to easily toggle or close a menu just from a page's\n * template, you can use `menuToggle` and/or `menuClose` to accomplish the same\n * tasks as above.\n *\n *\n * ### Apps With Left And Right Menus\n *\n * For apps with a left and right menu, you can control the desired\n * menu by passing in the side of the menu.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu side=\"left\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * <ion-menu side=\"right\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * <ion-nav #mycontent [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n *  openLeftMenu() {\n *    this.menu.open('left');\n *  }\n *\n *  closeRightMenu() {\n *    this.menu.close('right');\n *  }\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Apps With Multiple, Same Side Menus\n *\n * Since more than one menu on a the same side is possible, and you wouldn't want\n * both to be open at the same time, an app can decide which menu should be enabled.\n * For apps with multiple menus on the same side, it's required to give each menu a\n * unique ID. In the example below, we're saying that the left menu with the\n * `authenticated` id should be enabled, and the left menu with the `unauthenticated`\n * id be disabled.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu id=\"authenticated\" side=\"left\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * <ion-menu id=\"unauthenticated\" side=\"left\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * <ion-nav #mycontent [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n *  enableAuthenticatedMenu() {\n *    this.menu.enable(true, 'authenticated');\n *    this.menu.enable(false, 'unauthenticated');\n *  }\n * ```\n *\n * Note that if an app only had one menu, there is no reason to pass a menu id.\n *\n *\n * ### Menu Types\n *\n * Menu supports two display types: `overlay`, `reveal` and `push`. Overlay\n * is the traditional Material Design drawer type, and Reveal is the traditional\n * iOS type. By default, menus will use to the correct type for the platform,\n * but this can be overriden using the `type` property:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu type=\"overlay\" [content]=\"mycontent\">...</ion-menu>\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Persistent Menus\n *\n * By default, menus, and specifically their menu toggle buttons in the navbar,\n * only show on the root page within its `NavController`. For example, on Page 1\n * the menu toggle will show in the navbar. However, when navigating to Page 2,\n * because it is not the root Page for that `NavController`, the menu toggle\n * will not show in the navbar.\n *\n * Not showing the menu toggle button in the navbar is commonly seen within\n * native apps after navigating past the root Page. However, it is still possible\n * to always show the menu toggle button in the navbar by setting\n * `persistent=\"true\"` on the `ion-menu` component.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-menu persistent=\"true\" [content]=\"content\">...</ion-menu>\n * ```\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/menu/\n *\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#menus Menu Component Docs}\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#navigation Navigation Component Docs}\n * @see {@link ../../nav/Nav Nav API Docs}\n *\n */\nvar MenuController = (function () {\n    function MenuController() {\n        this._menus = [];\n    }\n    /**\n     * Progamatically open the Menu.\n     * @return {Promise} returns a promise when the menu is fully opened\n     */\n    MenuController.prototype.open = function (menuId) {\n        var menu = this.get(menuId);\n        if (menu) {\n            return menu.open();\n        }\n        return Promise.resolve(false);\n    };\n    /**\n     * Progamatically close the Menu.

You use navigation controllers\n * to navigate to [pages](#creating_pages) in your app. At a basic level, a\n * navigation controller is an array of pages representing a particular history\n * (of a Tab for example). This array can be manipulated to navigate throughout\n * an app by pushing and popping pages or inserting and removing them at\n * arbitrary locations in history.\n *\n * The current page is the last one in the array, or the top of the stack if we\n * think of it that way.  [Pushing](#push) a new page onto the top of the\n * navigation stack causes the new page to be animated in, while [popping](#pop)\n * the current page will navigate to the previous page in the stack.\n *\n * Unless you are using a directive like [NavPush](../NavPush/), or need a\n * specific NavController, most times you will inject and use a reference to the\n * nearest NavController to manipulate the navigation stack.\n *\n * <h3 id=\"injecting_nav_controller\">Injecting NavController</h3>\n * Injecting NavController will always get you an instance of the nearest\n * NavController, regardless of whether it is a Tab or a Nav.\n *\n * Behind the scenes, when Ionic instantiates a new NavController, it creates an\n * injector with NavController bound to that instance (usually either a Nav or\n * Tab) and adds the injector to its own providers.  For more information on\n * providers and dependency injection, see [Providers and DI]().\n *\n * Instead, you can inject NavController and know that it is the correct\n * navigation controller for most situations (for more advanced situations, see\n * [Menu](../../Menu/Menu/) and [Tab](../../Tab/Tab/)).\n *\n * ```ts\n *  class MyComponent {\n *    constructor(nav: NavController) {\n *      this.nav = nav;\n *    }\n *  }\n * ```\n *\n * <h2 id=\"creating_pages\">Page creation</h2>\n * _For more information on the `@Page` decorator see the [@Page API\n * reference](../../../decorators/Page/)._\n *\n * Pages are created when they are added to the navigation stack.  For methods\n * like [push()](#push), the NavController takes any component class that is\n * decorated with `@Page` as its first argument.  The NavController then\n * compiles that component, adds it to the app and animates it into view.\n *\n * By default, pages are cached and left in the DOM if they are navigated away\n * from but still in the navigation stack (the exiting page on a `push()` for\n * example).  They are destroyed when removed from the navigation stack (on\n * [pop()](#pop) or [setRoot()](#setRoot)).\n *\n *\n * <h2 id=\"Lifecycle\">Lifecycle events</h2>\n * Lifecycle events are fired during various stages of navigation.  They can be\n * defined in any `@Page` decorated component class.\n *\n * ```ts\n * @Page({\n *   template: 'Hello World'\n * })\n * class HelloWorld {\n *   onPageLoaded() {\n *     console.log(\"I'm alive!\");\n *   }\n *   onPageWillLeave() {\n *     console.log(\"Looks like I'm about to leave :(\");\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n * - `onPageLoaded` - Runs when the page has loaded. This event only happens once per page being created and added to the DOM. If a page leaves but is cached, then this event will not fire again on a subsequent viewing.

This event will fire, whether it was the first load or a cached page.\n * - `onPageWillLeave` - Runs when the page is about to leave and no longer be the active page.\n * - `onPageDidLeave` - Runs when the page has finished leaving and is no longer the active page.\n * - `onPageWillUnload` - Runs when the page is about to be destroyed and have its elements removed.\n * - `onPageDidUnload` - Runs after the page has been destroyed and its elements have been removed.\n *\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#navigation Navigation Component Docs}\n */\nvar NavController = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NavController, _super);\n    function NavController(parent, _app, config, _keyboard, elementRef, _anchorName, _compiler, _viewManager, _zone, _renderer) {\n        _super.call(this, elementRef);\n        this._app = _app;\n        this._keyboard = _keyboard;\n        this._anchorName = _anchorName;\n        this._compiler = _compiler;\n        this._viewManager = _viewManager;\n        this._zone = _zone;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._transIds = 0;\n        this._init = false;\n        this._ids = -1;\n        this._trnsTime = 0;\n        this._views = [];\n        this.parent = parent;\n        this.config = config;\n        this._trnsDelay = config.get('pageTransitionDelay');\n        this._sbEnabled = config.getBoolean('swipeBackEnabled') || false;\n        this._sbThreshold = config.get('swipeBackThreshold') || 40;\n        this.id = (++ctrlIds).toString();\n        // build a new injector for child ViewControllers to use\n        this.providers = core_1.Injector.resolve([\n            core_1.provide(NavController, { useValue: this })\n        ]);\n    }\n    /**\n     * Set the root for the current navigation stack\n     * @param {Type} page  The name of the component you want to push on the navigation stack\n     * @param {object} [params={}] Any nav-params you want to pass along to the next view\n     * @param {object} [opts={}] Any options you want to use pass to transtion\n     * @returns {Promise} Returns a promise when done\n     */\n    NavController.prototype.setRoot = function (page, params, opts) {\n        return this.setPages([{ page: page, params: params }], opts);\n    };\n    /**\n     * You can set the views of the current navigation stack and navigate to the last view past\n     *\n     *\n     *```typescript\n     * import {Page, NavController} from 'ionic-angular'\n     * import {Detail} from '../detail/detail'\n     * import {Info} from '../info/info'\n     *\n     *  export class Home {\n     *    constructor(nav: NavController) {\n     *      this.nav = nav;\n     *    }\n     *    setPages() {\n     *      this.nav.setPages([ {page: List}, {page: Detail}, {page:Info} ]);\n     *    }\n     *  }\n     *```\n     *\n     *\n     *In this example, we're giving the current nav stack an array of pages.

The\n * `refresh` output event is fired when the user has pulled down far\n * enough to kick off the refreshing process. Once the async operation\n * has completed and the refreshing should end, call `complete()`.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```html\n * <ion-content>\n *\n *   <ion-refresher (refresh)=\"doRefresh($event)\">\n *     <ion-refresher-content></ion-refresher-content>\n *   </ion-refresher>\n *\n * </ion-content>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * @Page({...})\n * export class NewsFeedPage {\n *\n *   doRefresh(refresher) {\n *     console.log('Begin async operation', refresher);\n *\n *     setTimeout(() => {\n *       console.log('Async operation has ended');\n *       refresher.complete();\n *     }, 2000);\n *   }\n *\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ## Refresher Content\n *\n * By default, Ionic provides the pulling icon and refreshing spinner that\n * looks best for the platform the user is on. However, you can change the\n * default icon and spinner, along with adding text for each state by\n * adding properties to the child `ion-refresher-content` component.\n *\n *  ```html\n *  <ion-content>\n *\n *    <ion-refresher (refresh)=\"doRefresh($event)\">\n *      <ion-refresher-content\n *        pullingIcon=\"arrow-dropdown\"\n *        pullingText=\"Pull to refresh\"\n *        refreshingSpinner=\"circles\"\n *        refreshingText=\"Refreshing...\">\n *      </ion-refresher-content>\n *    </ion-refresher>\n *\n *  </ion-content>\n *  ```\n *\n *\n * ## Further Customizing Refresher Content\n *\n * The `ion-refresher` component holds the refresh logic.\n * It requires a child component in order to display the content.\n * Ionic uses `ion-refresher-content` by default. This component\n * displays the refresher and changes the look depending\n * on the refresher's state. Separating these components\n * allows developers to create their own refresher content\n * components. You could replace our default content with\n * custom SVG or CSS animations.\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/refresher/\n *\n */\nvar Refresher = (function () {\n    function Refresher(_content, _zone, elementRef) {\n        this._content = _content;\n        this._zone = _zone;\n        this._appliedStyles = false;\n        this._lastStart = 0;\n        this._lastCheck = 0;\n        this._isEnabled = true;\n        /**\n         * The current state which the refresher is in.

You can use the `(select)` event to call a method on your\n * class. Below is an example of presenting a modal from one of the tabs.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-tabs preloadTabs=\"false\">\n *   <ion-tab (select)=\"chat()\"></ion-tab>\n * </ion-tabs>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * export class Tabs {\n *   constructor(nav: NavController){\n *     this.nav = nav;\n *   }\n *   chat() {\n *     let modal = Modal.create(ChatPage);\n *     this.nav.present(modal);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/tabs/\n */\nvar Tab = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(Tab, _super);\n    function Tab(parentTabs, app, config, keyboard, elementRef, compiler, viewManager, zone, renderer) {\n        // A Tab is a NavController for its child pages\n        _super.call(this, parentTabs, app, config, keyboard, elementRef, 'contents', compiler, viewManager, zone, renderer);\n        /**\n         * @output {Tab} Method to call when the current tab is selected\n         */\n        this.select = new core_2.EventEmitter();\n        parentTabs.add(this);\n        this._panelId = 'tabpanel-' + this.id;\n        this._btnId = 'tab-' + this.id;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @private\n     */\n    Tab.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n        this.tabBadgeStyle = this.tabBadgeStyle ?

When users tap the select component, a\n * dialog will appear with all of the options in a large, easy to select list\n * for users.\n *\n * Under-the-hood the `ion-select` actually uses the\n * {@link ../../alert/Alert Alert API} to open up the overlay of options\n * which the user is presented with. Select can take numerous child\n * `ion-option` components. If `ion-option` is not given a `value` attribute\n * then it will use its text as the value.\n *\n * ### Single Value: Radio Buttons\n *\n * The standard `ion-select` component allows the user to select only one\n * option. When selecting only one option the alert overlay presents users with\n * a radio button styled list of options. The `ion-select` component's value\n * receives the value of the selected option's value.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Gender</ion-label>\n *   <ion-select [(ngModel)]=\"gender\">\n *     <ion-option value=\"f\" checked=\"true\">Female</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option value=\"m\">Male</ion-option>\n *   </ion-select>\n * </ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Multiple Value: Checkboxes\n *\n * By adding the `multiple=\"true\"` attribute to `ion-select`, users are able\n * to select multiple options. When multiple options can be selected, the alert\n * overlay presents users with a checkbox styled list of options. The\n * `ion-select multiple=\"true\"` component's value receives an array of all the\n * selected option values. In the example below, because each option is not given\n * a `value`, then it'll use its text as the value instead.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-item>\n *   <ion-label>Toppings</ion-label>\n *   <ion-select [(ngModel)]=\"toppings\" multiple=\"true\">\n *     <ion-option>Bacon</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Black Olives</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Extra Cheese</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Mushrooms</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Pepperoni</ion-option>\n *     <ion-option>Sausage</ion-option>\n *   </ion-select>\n * <ion-item>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Alert Buttons\n * By default, the two buttons read `Cancel` and `OK`. The each button's text\n * can be customized using the `cancelText` and `okText` attributes:\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-select okText=\"Okay\" cancelText=\"Dismiss\">\n *   ...\n * </ion-select>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Alert Options\n *\n * Remember how `ion-select` is really just a wrapper to `Alert`? By using\n * the `alertOptions` property you can pass custom options to the alert\n * overlay. This would be useful if there is a custom alert title,\n * subtitle or message. {@link ../../alert/Alert Alert API}\n *\n * ```html\n * <ion-select [alertOptions]=\"alertOptions\">\n *   ...\n * </ion-select>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.alertOptions = {\n *   title: 'Pizza Toppings',\n *   subTitle: 'Select your toppings'\n * };\n * ```\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/select/\n */\nvar Select = (function () {\n    function Select(_form, _elementRef, _renderer, _item, _nav) {\n        this._form = _form;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._item = _item;\n        this._nav = _nav;\n        this._disabled = false;\n        this._multi = false;\n        this._values = [];\n        this._texts = [];\n        this._text = '';\n        this._isOpen = false;\n        /**\n         * @private\n         * @input {string}  The text of the cancel button.

An alert appears on top\n * of the app's content, and must be manually dismissed by the user before\n * they can resume interaction with the app. It can also optionally have a\n * `title`, `subTitle` and `message`.\n *\n * You can pass all of the alert's options in the first argument of\n * the create method: `Alert.create(opts)`. Otherwise the alert's instance\n * has methods to add options, such as `setTitle()` or `addButton()`.\n *\n *\n * ### Alert Buttons\n *\n * In the array of `buttons`, each button includes properties for its `text`,\n * and optionally a `handler`. If a handler returns `false` then the alert\n * will not automatically be dismissed when the button is clicked. All\n * buttons will show  up in the order they have been added to the `buttons`\n * array, from left to right. Note: The right most button (the last one in\n * the array) is the main button.\n *\n * Optionally, a `role` property can be added to a button, such as `cancel`.\n * If a `cancel` role is on one of the buttons, then if the alert is\n * dismissed by tapping the backdrop, then it will fire the handler from\n * the button with a cancel role.\n *\n *\n * ### Alert Inputs\n *\n * Alerts can also include several different inputs whose data can be passed\n * back to the app. Inputs can be used as a simple way to prompt users for\n * information. Radios, checkboxes and text inputs are all accepted, but they\n * cannot be mixed. For example, an alert could have all radio button inputs,\n * or all checkbox inputs, but the same alert cannot mix radio and checkbox\n * inputs. Do note however, different types of \"text\"\" inputs can be mixed,\n * such as `url`, `email`, `text`, etc. If you require a complex form UI\n * which doesn't fit within the guidelines of an alert then we recommend\n * building the form within a modal instead.\n *\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * constructor(nav: NavController) {\n *   this.nav = nav;\n * }\n *\n * presentAlert() {\n *   let alert = Alert.create({\n *     title: 'Low battery',\n *     subTitle: '10% of battery remaining',\n *     buttons: ['Dismiss']\n *   });\n *   this.nav.present(alert);\n * }\n *\n * presentConfirm() {\n *   let alert = Alert.create({\n *     title: 'Confirm purchase',\n *     message: 'Do you want to buy this book?',\n *     buttons: [\n *       {\n *         text: 'Cancel',\n *         role: 'cancel',\n *         handler: () => {\n *           console.log('Cancel clicked');\n *         }\n *       },\n *       {\n *         text: 'Buy',\n *         handler: () => {\n *           console.log('Buy clicked');\n *         }\n *       }\n *     ]\n *   });\n *   this.nav.present(alert);\n * }\n *\n * presentPrompt() {\n *   let alert = Alert.create({\n *     title: 'Login',\n *     inputs: [\n *       {\n *         name: 'username',\n *         placeholder: 'Username'\n *       },\n *       {\n *         name: 'password',\n *         placeholder: 'Password',\n *         type: 'password'\n *       }\n *     ],\n *     buttons: [\n *       {\n *         text: 'Cancel',\n *         role: 'cancel',\n *         handler: data => {\n *           console.log('Cancel clicked');\n *         }\n *       },\n *       {\n *         text: 'Login',\n *         handler: data => {\n *           if (User.isValid(data.username, data.password)) {\n *             // logged in!\n *           } else {\n *             // invalid login\n *             return false;\n *           }\n *         }\n *       }\n *     ]\n *   });\n *   this.nav.present(alert);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/alert/\n */\nvar Alert = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(Alert, _super);\n    function Alert(opts) {\n        if (opts === void 0) { opts = {}; }\n        opts.inputs = opts.inputs || [];\n        opts.buttons = opts.buttons || [];\n        opts.enableBackdropDismiss = util_1.isPresent(opts.enableBackdropDismiss) ? !!opts.enableBackdropDismiss : true;\n        _super.call(this, AlertCmp, opts);\n        this.viewType = 'alert';\n        this.isOverlay = true;\n        // by default, alerts should not fire lifecycle events of other views\n        // for example, when an alert enters, the current active view should\n        // not fire its lifecycle events because it's not conceptually leaving\n        this.fireOtherLifecycles = false;\n    }\n    /**\n    * @private\n    */\n    Alert.prototype.getTransitionName = function (direction) {\n        var key = (direction === 'back' ?

As a subclass of NavController\n * you use it to navigate to pages in your app and manipulate the navigation stack.\n * Nav automatically animates transitions between pages for you.\n *\n * For more information on using navigation controllers like Nav or [Tab](../../Tabs/Tab/),\n * take a look at the [NavController API reference](../NavController/).\n *\n * You must set a root page (where page is any [@Page](../../config/Page/)\n * component) to be loaded initially by any Nav you create, using\n * the 'root' property:\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * import {GettingStartedPage} from 'getting-started';\n * @App({\n *   template: `<ion-nav [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>`\n * })\n * class MyApp {\n *   constructor(){\n *     this.rootPage = GettingStartedPage;\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * <h2 id=\"back_navigation\">Back navigation</h2>\n * If a [page](../NavController/#creating_pages) you navigate to has a [NavBar](../NavBar/),\n * Nav will automatically add a back button to it if there is a page\n * before the one you are navigating to in the navigation stack.\n *\n * Additionally, specifying the `swipe-back-enabled` property will allow you to\n * swipe to go back:\n * ```html\n * <ion-nav swipe-back-enabled=\"false\" [root]=\"rootPage\"></ion-nav>\n * ```\n *\n * Here is a diagram of how Nav animates smoothly between pages:\n *\n * <div class=\"highlight

It appears on top of the app's content, and must be manually\n * dismissed by the user before they can resume interaction with the app.\n * Dangerous (destructive) options are made obvious in `ios` mode. There are easy\n * ways to cancel out of the action sheet, such as tapping the backdrop or\n * hitting the escape key on desktop.\n *\n * An action sheet is created from an array of `buttons`, with each button\n * including properties for its `text`, and optionally a `handler` and `role`.\n * If a handler returns `false` then the action sheet will not be dismissed. An\n * action sheet can also optionally have a `title` and a `subTitle`.\n *\n * A button's `role` property can either be `destructive` or `cancel`. Buttons\n * without a role property will have the default look for the platform. Buttons\n * with the `cancel` role will always load as the bottom button, no matter where\n * they are in the array. All other buttons will be displayed in the order they\n * have been added to the `buttons` array. Note: We recommend that `destructive`\n * buttons are always the first button in the array, making them the top button.\n * Additionally, if the action sheet is dismissed by tapping the backdrop, then\n * it will fire the handler from the button with the cancel role.\n *\n * You can pass all of the action sheet's options in the first argument of\n * the create method: `ActionSheet.create(opts)`. Otherwise the action sheet's\n * instance has methods to add options, like `setTitle()` or `addButton()`.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * constructor(nav: NavController) {\n *   this.nav = nav;\n * }\n *\n * presentActionSheet() {\n *   let actionSheet = ActionSheet.create({\n *     title: 'Modify your album',\n *     buttons: [\n *       {\n *         text: 'Destructive',\n *         role: 'destructive',\n *         handler: () => {\n *           console.log('Destructive clicked');\n *         }\n *       },\n *       {\n *         text: 'Archive',\n *         handler: () => {\n *           console.log('Archive clicked');\n *         }\n *       },\n *       {\n *         text: 'Cancel',\n *         role: 'cancel',\n *         handler: () => {\n *           console.log('Cancel clicked');\n *         }\n *       }\n *     ]\n *   });\n *\n *   this.nav.present(actionSheet);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @demo /docs/v2/demos/action-sheet/\n * @see {@link /docs/v2/components#action-sheets ActionSheet Component Docs}\n */\nvar ActionSheet = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(ActionSheet, _super);\n    function ActionSheet(opts) {\n        if (opts === void 0) { opts = {}; }\n        opts.buttons = opts.buttons || [];\n        opts.enableBackdropDismiss = util_1.isPresent(opts.enableBackdropDismiss) ? !!opts.enableBackdropDismiss : true;\n        _super.call(this, ActionSheetCmp, opts);\n        this.viewType = 'action-sheet';\n        this.isOverlay = true;\n        // by default, actionsheets should not fire lifecycle events of other views\n        // for example, when an actionsheets enters, the current active view should\n        // not fire its lifecycle events because it's not conceptually leaving\n        this.fireOtherLifecycles = false;\n    }\n    /**\n    * @private\n    */\n    ActionSheet.prototype.getTransitionName = function (direction) {\n        var key = 'actionSheet' + (direction === 'back' ?

A modal uses the\n * `NavController` to\n * {@link /docs/v2/api/components/nav/NavController/#present present}\n * itself in the root nav stack. It is added to the stack similar to how\n * {@link /docs/v2/api/components/nav/NavController/#push NavController.push}\n * works.\n *\n * When a modal (or any other overlay such as an alert or actionsheet) is\n * \"presented\" to a nav controller, the overlay is added to the app's root nav.\n * After the modal has been presented, from within the component instance The\n * modal can later be closed or \"dismissed\" by using the ViewController's\n * `dismiss` method. Additionally, you can dismiss any overlay by using `pop`\n * on the root nav controller.\n *\n * Data can be passed to a new modal through `Modal.create()` as the second\n * argument. The data can gen be accessed from the opened page by injecting\n * `NavParams`. Note that the page, which opened as a modal, has no special\n * \"modal\" logic within it, but uses `NavParams` no differently than a\n * standard page.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```ts\n * import {Page, Modal, NavController, NavParams} from 'ionic-angular';\n *\n * @Page(...)\n * class HomePage {\n *\n *  constructor(nav: NavController) {\n *    this.nav = nav;\n *  }\n *\n *  presentProfileModal() {\n *    let profileModal = Modal.create(Profile, { userId: 8675309 });\n *    this.nav.present(profileModal);\n *  }\n *\n * }\n *\n * @Page(...)\n * class Profile {\n *\n *  constructor(params: NavParams) {\n *    console.log('UserId', params.get('userId'));\n *  }\n *\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * A modal can also emit data, which is useful when it is used to add or edit\n * data.
