<!-- Getting Started
  ================================================== -->

<section class="docs-section active" id="overview">

  <h1 class="title"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h1>

  <p>Welcome! Ionic is a powerful HTML5 SDK that helps you build native-feeling mobile apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
  <p>
  Ionic is focused mainly on the look and feel, and UI interaction of your app. That means we aren't a replacement for <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> or your favorite Javascript framework. Instead, Ionic simply fits in well with these projects in order to simplify one big part of your app: the front end. We recommend reading <a href="https://blog.ionicframework.com/where-does-the-ionic-framework-fit-in/">Where does the Ionic Framework fit in?</a> to get a good understanding of Ionic's goals.
  </p>
  <p>/
    <b>Ionic currently requires AngularJS</b> in order to work at its full potential. While you can still use the CSS portion of the framework, you'll miss out on powerful UI interactions, gestures, animations, and other things.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will be releasing Cordova/PhoneGap plugins in the future to expand the capabilities of your apps.

<!-- Seed
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="starter">

  <h2 class="title"><a href="#starter">Command Line Utility and Seed Project</a></h2>

  <p>
    We have a node.js utility that can be used to quickly start an Ionic project. We are working to build out the functionality of this tool, but right now you can
    quickly create a project with our <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-base">seed project</a> by doing:
  </p>
  <p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ npm install -g ionic
$ ionic start myproject --type ionic1
{% endhighlight %}
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also clone the <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-base">seed project</a> itself, which gives you everything you need to build Ionic apps with Cordova and AngularJS.
  </p>

<!-- What's Included
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="whats-included">

  <h2 class="title"><a href="#whats-included">What's Included</a></h2>
  <p>
    Ionic comes with compiled Javascript and CSS for your app, optional Sass files and JS Framework extensions, along with a great <a href="http://ionicons.com/">icon pack</a>.
  </p>
</section>


<!-- CSS/Sass
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="css-sass">

  <h2 class="title"><a href="#css-sass">CSS/Sass</a></h2>

  <p>
    The CSS can stand on its own, but it is also built to be enhanced by the developer. For simplicity, you can always just add in your own CSS and override default properties. And for even more power and flexibility, the core is written with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and includes easily customized variables and mixins. While the default design is similar to iOS, we feel we’ve left the CSS in a state which can be easily extended to get your own look and feel.

<!-- Cordova
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="cordova">

  <h2 class="title"><a href="#cordova">Cordova/PhoneGap/Trigger.io</a></h2>

  <p>
    To add Ionic to your <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>, <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, or <a href="https://trigger.io/">Trigger.io</a> project, just reference the Ionic CSS and JS files from the web root of your app.
  </p>

  <p>
    The CSS and JS files can be found in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionic-sdk">ionic-sdk</a> npm package.
    You can also download them directly at <a href="https://code.ionicframework.com/">https://code.ionicframework.com/</a> or in the github repo: <a href="https://code.ionicframework.com/">https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic</a>. The release directory will have the files you need: <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/tree/master/release">https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/tree/master/release</a>. The "Manual Start" section of the README also goes through some other ways to install.

<!-- Browser Support
  ================================================== -->
<section class="docs-section" id="browser-support">

  <h2 class="title"><a href="#browser-support">Browser Support</a></h2>

  <h3>Ionic 1</h3>

  <p>
    Ionic V1 is focused on building <strong>native/hybrid</strong> mobile apps rather than mobile websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    As such, our browser support tends to be whatever Web View API is available to native apps on a given platform.
    For Ionic 1x, that means UIWebView for iOS 7+, and Android 4.1 and up. We recommend using <a href="https://github.com/crosswalk-project/cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview">Crosswalk</a> to improve performance on older devices.
  </p>


  <h3>Ionic 2</h3>

  <p>Ionic 2 is focused on building both native/hybrid apps through Cordova, as well as adding the ability for <a href="/docs/resources/progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web Apps</a> and <a href="http://electron.atom.io">Electron</a>  .</p>
  <p>The following OSs and browsers are supported: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>iOS 8+</li>
    <li>Windows 10 Universal App</li>
    <li>Android 4.4+
      <ul>
        <li>Support can be pushed back to 4.1 if Crosswalk is used with Cordova</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<!-- About Ionic

<section class="docs-section" id="about">
  <h2 class="title"><a href="#about">About Ionic</a></h2>
  <p>
    Ionic was built by <a href="http://twitter.com/benjsperry" target="_blank">@benjsperry</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/adamdbradley" target="_blank">@adamdbradley</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/maxlynch" target="_blank">@maxlynch</a> at <a href="http://drifty.com/" target="_blank">Drifty</a>, an independent bootstrapped software company and makers of such fine products as <a href="http://codiqa.com/" target="_blank">Codiqa</a> and <a href="http://jetstrap.com/" target="_blank">Jetstrap</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ionic was built to take HTML5 on mobile into the future. We wanted a mobile development SDK that not only looked and worked great, but was also powerful enough to build the amazing apps the best developers were creating. HTML5's time has arrived. Ionic proves it.
