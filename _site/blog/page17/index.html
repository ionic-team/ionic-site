    <p>When we started planning to build what soon became <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>, we knew that we needed to take a native-focused approach to building the next great HTML5 development framework.</p>

<p>We felt that there were plenty of web-focused HTML5 frameworks, but few that treated HTML5 as a first-class citizen in the app store. We couldn&#39;t ignore that people increasingly look to the app store to find apps, rather than browse the web for them.</p>

<p>One big difference that kept coming up between web apps and native apps is how they handle URLs. Web apps utilize URLs both for the developer&#39;s convenience but also for the user&#39;s, allowing people all over the world to link directly to content and using them to delineate parts of a user interface. Native apps, in comparison, don&#39;t use URLs for UI interactions, or use them only under the hood for the developer&#39;s convenience.</p>

<p>In a native app, a user will never see any URLs even if the app is using URL based routing underneath. Obviously there are no URL bars or browser chrome in a native app so having URLs doesn&#39;t make sense. When used, it&#39;s merely a convenient way to manage UI state for the developer.</p>

<p>Yet most current HTML5 development frameworks have kept URLs as a core concept, limiting a lot of UI interaction to those that can triggered through an anchor like <code>&lt;a href=&quot;nextPage.html&quot;&gt;</code>. Things like switching to a new page, popping up a dialog box, or linking tabs. It&#39;s probably out of developer comfort, but also because the history of HTML5 and web technology is rooted in the browser app. But even then, URLs were meant to link to specific resources on the web, not to control user interface interactions.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with native app development, you&#39;ll know that native apps tend to utilize a lower level design pattern called the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/Introduction/Introduction.html">View Controller</a> pattern (ignore the Model portion for now). The idea is pretty simple: you have a set of views (think of them as boxes or rectangles where UI elements are drawn), and then controllers that manage multiple views in tandem.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITabBarController_Class/Reference/Reference.html">UITabBarController</a> on iOS is a perfect example of this. It takes a set of child controllers which each have their own set of views that make up each &quot;page&quot; in the tabs, and manages tabbing between them:</p>

<div class="phone">
  <img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5330/9023342228_8341c60043_b.jpg" alt="UITabController">
</div>

<div class="caption">(don't forget to drink your vitamins, all day every day)</div>

<p>In the screenshot of the iOS Alarm app above, you&#39;ll notice four tab buttons with four possible pages of the tab you can select. We are currently on the &quot;Alarm&quot; tab. The UITabBarController holds a reference to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITabBar_Class/Reference/Reference.html">UITabBar</a> view at the bottom (it even creates it for you), and then when a tab is selected, the controller makes sure to switch the pages for you.</p>

<p>In a Web App, you might have a distinct URL for each page in the tab. That wouldn&#39;t be the worst thing in the world for a hybrid/native app, but it soon breaks down when we look at more complicated native apps. For example, the great <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yahoo-weather/id628677149?mt=8">Yahoo! Weather</a> app:</p>

<div class="phone">
  <img src="http://ionicframework.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/madison_weather.jpg" alt="Yahoo! Weather">
</div>

<p>If you haven&#39;t used the Yahoo Weather app before (highly recommended), it features one single pane that scrolls up displaying a variety of weather information. The user can also swipe in between each city they&#39;ve added, showing weather for that city:</p>

<div class="phone">
  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ionicframework.com/blog/weather3.jpg" alt="Yahoo! Weather Cities">
</div>

<p>Imagine trying to model this drag animation using a URL-to-City approach in a back or frontend framework that uses route based navigation. Let&#39;s say the first page is <code>/cities/current</code> and the second page is <code>/cities/Madison-WI</code>. When the user starts dragging to the next page, what happens? Do we navigate to <code>/cities/Madison-WI</code>, or do we wait until they complete the drag? If the routing system uses the URL state to know when to render each page, then we are stuck trying to hack around the router.</p>

<p>Instead of being a convenience, URL-based routing becomes an artistic restriction.</p>

<h2>Ionic: Native Applied to Web, And Back Again</h2>

<p>To native developers, this all might seem like a pedantic exercise, but for web developers moving to native development, it is often quite a change to not use URLs for common UI interactions. We don&#39;t just link to different pages using <code>&lt;a href=&quot;page2.html&quot;&gt;</code>, we use more subtle tools often powered by touch, letting the user treat our app as an open canvas.</p>

<p>With Ionic, we wanted to apply these native design patterns to web development. And in doing so, we realized something really exciting: <em>HTML5 was just as powerful and flexible as native development</em>. But better still, it had some major benefits over native: it was faster to build in, easier to port across platforms, and known by a lot more developers.</p>

<p>We realized that if we could build an HTML5 framework that loved native design concepts instead of avoiding them, we could enable developers to build any kind of app they dreamed up, not just ones that worked with the URL pattern.</p>

<p>So we decided to apply the View Controller pattern to a lot of the ways developers build UI interactions in Ionic. If you are a web developer that hasn&#39;t had much experience with native development, it will probably feel a bit strange at first. We are confident that once you see what is possible when you free yourself from the URL, you&#39;ll feel quite empowered to build great apps in HTML5.</p>

    <p>When reviewing any new technology, library, or framework, you’ll first ask, “Where does this fit into the stack, and how would it benefit me?” TL;DR: Ionic’s ultimate goal is to make it easier to develop native mobile apps with HTML5, also known as Hybrid apps.</p>

<h3>The Missing Piece</h3>

<p>Every semi-colon slinging cowboy is out riding alone in the wild-west of building native apps with HTML5. Great tools like <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> and <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a> that package up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into multi-platform native apps already exist. Developers are skilled at creating web-based applications and there is a magnitude of resources to pull from. However, in today’s landscape we feel there is something missing to easily bridge the gap between HTML5 and native app development.</p>

<h3>Compare it to something I know</h3>

<p>While Ionic is not an exact one-for-one comparison to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, it may be helpful when explaining where Ionic fits in. Let’s jump in the wayback machine and recall a time prior to the popularity of front-end frameworks. Developers were laying down some mean code, but they had to start from scratch for each project, and individually figure out the quirks of each browser. Eventually developers were given a huge push forward by starting projects with the <em>[insert your favorite front-end framework here]</em>.</p>

<p>Great frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap simply make it easier to develop web apps and web sites, not because developers can’t write it themselves, but because it gives them a great starting point to build high-quality projects. Immediate benefits include a slick design and built-in cross-browser testing at no cost. But in my opinion, the great achievements of Twitter Bootstrap are the knowledge sharing it has brought developers, and the excellent way to document and promote recommended design patterns it provides.</p>

    <p><img class="showcase-image" src="/img/blog/ionicons-preview.png"></p>

<p>When we went to build <a href="http://ionicframework.com">Ionic</a>, we knew that great design would be crucial in an amazing HTML5 mobile app development framework. This meant we had to cover a lot of (visual) bases with the design, but few design challenges were as daunting as iconography.</p>

<p>People are going to use icons in their designs. That is a given. So, what icons would we offer with Ionic? Would we just let people figure it out themselves, or bundle in an existing icon pack? How would we manage licensing of external icon packs?</p>

<p>Eventually, it became clear to us that in order to create a premier framework, we would need to have complete control over what we offered in order to ensure the highest standard of quality.</p>

<p>We didn’t want to force people to find their own icons (unless they wanted to), nor did we feel comfortable bundling in existing packs which we had little control and creative vision over. It seemed unavoidable that if we wanted high quality icons included with Ionic, they would need to be designed in house.</p>

<p>It was an easy decision to go the route of making an icon font instead of using images. Icon fonts are better in pretty much every way imaginable, most notably the fact that they are vector based, which means they scale perfectly to any resolution. They look great on high-resolution displays such as iPhones and most Android devices. Moreover, they are all from one resource! That means fewer HTTP requests for various images, and zero sprite sheets.</p>

<p>It took over a month from start to “finish” (we’re still adding icons) to build <a href="http://ionicons.com" target="_blank">Ionicons</a>. During that time I learned a ton about how to build an icon font, and I thought it would be interesting to detail some of that here.</p>
